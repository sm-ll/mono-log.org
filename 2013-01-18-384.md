Creating minimal music has always been something of an oddity to me. Although there perhaps was a point at the beginning when first exploring the creative possibilities in minimal, that a stylistic direction may have been invovled, it does however become apparent very quickly that creating minimal work is not about style at all, and about process and the challenges of perspective.

Occasionally I might have someone say they listen to minimal, and generally speaking they are normally talking about minimal techno, a genre that is anything but minimal to my ears. In this sense minimal it is incorrectly understood and used as a style. I don't remember minimal ever being about style.

For me, and for many others who embrace minimal, it is more a delivery of a result through a process that utilises minimal techniques such as repetition, reduction, space, simplicity etc.

For me the emphasis is using these sort of techniques on a variety of areas in sound creation, perception, context. It spills over into how frequencies can be used, and how that can be designed to encourage particular types of listening conditions, the rate of sound delivery, bringing attention of the gaps between those sounds.

A constant questioning of what is just enough, and no more. Its not so much the reduction of sound, or the volume of that sound, but the reduction of the interfering in sounds being themselves, the reduction of creating complex sounds, the reduction of repetition itself even. What occurs is a constant battle in the creative process, a tugging back and forth between a fully formed track and a reduced version of this, an auditioning of a result and the general thoughts that might occur during that process, are all under constant evaluation.

To me this is minimal.
