## Revisiting again.
audio: 48

Today I am again revisiting a sound that was originally created using a combination of Nord & computer processing. Todays version of this sound created in the Nord Modular differs perhaps in that it is less refined than the original, although I am not entirely sure of that at the moment to be honest, and I will explain why.

As I have mentioned before, the way the Nord Modular works is there is a strong emphasis on the 'building' of sound as apposed to any reduction of it, a creative direction I might normally take. Often when I am able to work with a variety of tools, I tend to use a process that I describe as a sort of 'setting up' of the sound. To explain, this is basically done by creating sounds for the intention to alter them in some way and generally being one of a reductive nature. There is a multiple of ways in which this can be done, and as a result of exploring these comes a multiple of sounds also. 

With the Nord Modular this setting up or reductive process is largely removed. I am finding I use more and more patches to be able to feed one into another, to try and reach this reductive way of working. I often find after spending much time in the building and creating of a sound, I just want to take it all away again. :)

To clarify this building of sound in the Nord Modular and to hopefully show the complexity of a single patch, something I will talk about in a bit, I have attached a screen grab of what a single patch looks like. Just to be clear, this is not the patch I have used in todays upload but is actually 'one' of the four patches that were used in the <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_01/" title="first sound I uploaded">first sound I uploaded</a>.

I feel the 'seeing' of the sound as a patch of complex connections and not just hearing the sound, there occurs a complexity that is feeding into the process itself also, and for me this is proving the most challenging to work with, today being certainly a challenge. 

Even in the most basic of sounds, the patch in comparison can sometimes be unbelievable large. This busy visual information compared to that of what I hear, is unbalanced and as of yet I have not found a comfortable way to work with this. 

Obviously once the patch is no longer seen, and the sound is uploaded and arguably thought of as 'finished', then the complexity of the process is largely removed, but then it is to late to change anything anyway.

I don't feel that I have yet found a way to work with the Nord that allows simplicity in both the process and the audio that really works for me. This is not to say that I don't like the uploads, as generally I am pleased with most of them, but for me it has almost never been about what the end result sound is like, obviously this is important, but for me it is more about how we get there and what happens once we do that has always stood as the real interest for me. For example I could, and am in fact quite keen to try this, create the same sound over and over again, if only the process was the area to differ somehow. 

Finally this reminds me of an incredible moment created by the artist <a href="http://www.mikiyui.com/" title="Miki Yui">Miki Yui</a>, perhaps my all time favourite artist and one whom I feel is generally largely overlooked, the moment occurs in her recent album called<a href="http://www.mikiyui.com/maginaCD.html" title=" Magina"> Magina</a> in the piece called 'Spacemelo'. In this piece a melody is revisited over and over, but recorded from different locations, presumably the result of different version's of the same installation, documented and placed together. It is a beautiful and well executed idea and I highly recommend buying all her work.
