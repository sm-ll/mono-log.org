## Basic structure exploration.

Tonight has brought with it the first time in a long while whereby an 4/4 techno styled pattern has been created. I believe it is partly due to my listening to techno a great deal over the past few days, but also I feel the 'reason' I have been listening to techno is to find an almost fluid structure of sorts within something that is generally quite rigid.

If the structure breaks entirely, it falls outside techno, but yet if it maintains certain traits from techno in its sound. I often find an atmospheric or ambient palette of a techno artist is very different to that of say someone who creates only ambient music and seems to sit more as an intro to techno more than an ambient track all on its own.

I think tonights upload is partly attempting to position myself within that language of techno once again, only to then find an interesting way of using that language of sounds, to be explored or position upon the cusp of context or genre. A sort of putting myself in a situation, only to learn how to move out of it.

I am very surprised to feel I can be allowed to create of explore style within this blog, which might seem an odd thing to say, but I suppose this is a lesson to us all of how other things really do influence. Even a blog that is supposed to aid me in exploring the Nord and be a creative output, has already shown me a restriction of what I feel I can or can't do. 

However, I wish to tackle this restriction of my own making, and attempt to tune into what my gut is telling me, and I hope you can follow me along this journey :)
