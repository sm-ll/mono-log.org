Aplogies for the late upload, I have had a busy day today, but the main reason for its lateness is just around midnight my internet connection went down, its just come back on now at 3:30AM…very frustrating.

Anyway, tonights upload is a sound I have worked in before in these uploads, and takes the form of lower frequencies, colliding with noise textures. I think tonight upload is perhaps the quickest one I have done so far, and I am really happy it has come together so quickly. I really wish they were all like this.

I spoke to a friend recently about I generally don't enjoy the process of making music. This might seem a little odd thing to say, but this has been the way for me ever since creating it from the age of ten years old. Its not that I hate it or anything, but its not something I do for enjoyment, in the obvious sense of enjoyment. Generally I find it hard work getting sounds to behave as I want them, not forgetting the many other aspects of creating and experimenting that leads to hours of feeling lost, frustrated, uncertain etc etc

I think my enjoyment comes during a small moment that doesn't last long, when things have gone through this creative stage, and I can reflect upon what I have done with a reaction much like today. Today I feel surprised, pleased with how quickly things worked out and don't feel like I have worked hard in this specific instance, but all my hard work over the years has paid off in someway through it being such a quick creation. As I say, I wish they were all like that.

I remember Autechre saying in an interview many years ago, how ultimately they would love to have the computer write their music for them, them playing the part of mere feeding it information for their pre-programmed systems to churn out to their delight. I agreed with them then, and I still much like that way of working now. 

I feel this slightly detached process, removes the emotional element to creation, and brings it into perceiving. For me this is a more interesting perspective to have when thinking about the creation of music. I believe my emotions run on a part instinct, a given context calls for a given reaction based on my experiences of those times past, and other reactions sometimes just don't fulfil that moment. Yet when presented with a sound that we have no pre-programming for, we have to fall into what systems work, and maybe start pushing up against the boundaries of those systems and even learn some new ones for the next time we might experience such originality. 

I think perhaps the reason why todays upload was so quick, was I new the sound I wanted, I knew how to get to it, and I just dialled it into somewhere pleasing to that type of sound. 

Due to this approach, I like todays upload. Partially as it sounds as I wanted it, and also partly as it sounds like someone else music I have always enjoyed, that of <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Stephan-Mathieu-Full-Swing-Edits-4/release/415948?ev=rr" title="Stephan Mathieu's Full Swing Edits, specifically Raumgestaklung Eins [070300] Edit" target="_blank">Stephan Mathieu's Full Swing Edits, specifically Raumgestaklung Eins [070300] Edit</a>…or track 5 to me.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload and my late night ramble. I have to say, perhaps the internet going off was a good thing, allowing me to type my post with less distractions. Food for thought.
