# 330
## Inkel jam.
audio: 330

After listening back to some uploads I decided on making some adjustments to the balance of sounds. Although quite happy with the results so far, it is obviously always good to experiment I think.

I have yet to listen to this on speakers as always working on headphones, but have used this upload to move around the frequencies a little more by jamming a bit with the Inkel mixer's EQ, sliders and delay. Also this upload should have more audible bass than some previous uploads, with this one working closer to 55Hz, as apposed to 35Hz.

When working on headphones an aggressive balance of the track is generally something I find hard to achieve, and detail takes precedence, which is partly why I prefer working on headphones. Aggression is generally not something I am able to create anymore, at least to my ears anyway :)

I hope you like todays upload and I hope it sounds good however you are listening to it.
