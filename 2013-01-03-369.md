## The label today, part 1

As we cross over into 2013, I am reminded of the labels that have come and gone. All have started with the uppermost enthusiasm dedicated in supporting their artists, to be a platform for emerging talent, and ultimately be something both label owners and artists can be proud of.

Yet with such an enthusiastic beginnings, many labels still stop in their early years.

As many of you know, I am also starting my own label called SM-LL. It was scheduled to be offically launched on January 1st. Today I was asked by a very good friend about did it launch yet? While on the phone I got quite frustrated at this question, as the situation I find myself in has caused a slight delay in its launch.

Although I am confident I can get back on track soon, the delay is largely through my desire to make sure SM-LL gets off to the right start and with a solid foundation, one that will ensure I am not another label that stops as soon as it starts.

Identifying and building this foundation is hard work, very hard work. But I believe that doing so will help go a long way in ensuring the label will have the manouverbility it needs to stay alive and stay exciting.

A theory that has been discussed over with friends for some time now, is whether or not the seemingly mass flux of non-profit labels is a good thing or not for the development of electronic music?

I can imagine some of you might be crying out what??? This is understandable, but bare with me in part 2 tomorrow.
