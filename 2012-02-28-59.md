# 59
## 51 variation.
audio: 59

A moody and textured variation of last Monday's upload and one I must say I prefer a great deal.

For me this is a good demonstration of the tweaking of a sound beyond that point of it being just ok, such as last Monday's, and taking it to a point slightly further down the road when things just seem to gel. I'm happy about this one, although is it my taste, perhaps not, perhaps slightly, but certainly closer.

A fitting image I feel, taken last Monday through our misty and dirty studio window.
