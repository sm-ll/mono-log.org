## Shifts in simplicity.

Recently I have been working on bringing back moize.net after its long period of not being used. Currently it is only being used really as a redirecting site and nothing much else, and I want to change that.

My main problem with bringing it back, was what would its purpose be and how would it function as the sort of site that I feel fits me? Up until now this has been a difficult problem to overcome and as a result it has been left untouched. Well, recently I have worked out how this site can play a role, and this has come to me largely through the interactions with people and doing this site mono-log. 

I thank you all.

As a result of the last few days of researching, designing, working on logos etc for moize.net, I have been largely working with grids, calculations and been very much absorbed in the world of design, a world I love and love learning about dearly. 

When considering the sort of way I like to work with sound, there is a shared similarity with design that comes as no coincidence. I don't come from a design background, but with such commonalities in both how I think and work with sound, it is a surprise really I didn't find design earlier.

For me, todays sound sits somewhere between those who inspire me in design and in sound, although rarely do these worlds cross in ways that I find inspiring, and currently I am not entirely sure why this is the case.

Todays picture seemed perfect, a shifting design that is able to present both enough information to comprehend its function, and yet be something quite beautiful and abstract alsoâ€¦thank you <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=seb&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=wim+crouwel" title="Wim Crouwel." target="_blank">Wim Crouwel.</a>
