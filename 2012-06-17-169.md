## Simple times.

Quick and rough ideas tonight with some simple experiments with tones and texture. It feels a bit messy as the patch was, but perhaps this will sound different in time, as things often tend to.

Just a quick message as late and have an early start tomorrow.

I hope it is an enjoyable one.
