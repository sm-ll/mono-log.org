For tonights upload, I am involving the people around me, good friends working together…it seems like a fitting thing to do considering the time of year. 

Thanks to Lucia, James and Tom for contributing in tonights upload, I really did very little, so thank you greatly for this gem of sound and texture, its beautiful.

So for todays post I wanted to briefly go over my process of how I create the uploads I share with you each day.

I think the first thing I should say is prior to these uploads there had been something of a large gap between the last time I had creating anything completely on my own. This gap was mainly due to my working with Lucia on our Mimosa Moize project, but also to my being somewhere between styles and not feeling overly confident about my direction in regards to my solo work.

The beginning of the Mono-log uploads was both to understand the Nord Modular at a deeper or more confident level, but also to deal with putting my own sounds and creative ideas into the public, and more importantly, doing so on a regular basis. This regularity turned out to be key in bringing confidence in my sound and the decisions I would make to create them.

Initially, the first collection of uploads used much of the techniques or more a perspective that was borrowed from how Mimosa Moize works. A focus on listening, questions of perception, using real world sounds or our relationships with them as inspiration or direction. For me this area of sound appreciation and sound creating, has been always around, although not so much with an avenue to create with. My perspective within this was one always torn between my interest in sound in general, and the idea or feeling that comes in just making tracks.

For me, the idea of making art, sound works or a track are very different, or rather these were different. It has taken this regularity to change my perspective to a point that allows them both to exist as equally worthy in my mind, in so much that they do not, or should not, need a different mind set in creating them. They are all intelligent forms of creativity, the task being just how to bring that to the fore in the creative output.

Its probably clear already, if not from what I have written already in this post, but also the posts before, that I take creating tracks, sketches, sound works, whatever you might like to call them, very seriously. I tend to find I think more, than use passion or emotion. For sure, I am passionate and emotional about sound, but these are not really the priorities in my mind when I create something.

If being more specific about creating, I would say generally I prefer to start with an idea. This idea is not so much now needing to be something fully formed, but can be just as easily a question, a 'what if', something to do with sound or the perception of it. It can be something to do with bringing different types of sounds together, or how those sounds might be perceived in the context that might be suggested with them. For example, I might upload a sound, associating it with an artist, cover art work, colour of cover art work, or suggestions in some other way, that for me both provide an indication of a context to be taken or not and to be used by me or not. I call this theory, 'The Sticker on the speaker', a title I will explain in a future post, but it essentially means bring something visual, or other, that references something to create a ballpark for where I want to be for when I start to create. Obviously, where things end up, is entirely another matter.

As part of this beginning of often use inspiration, influence from either my own creations before, or other peoples. I don't believe in originality as it might be normally thought of, and actually would prefer to copy something more than concern myself with it being original. This is more in the thinking of how to create, more than the actual act of creating itself. I would like to 'think' to copy something, as again a ballpark, a context for me. Perhaps this begins slightly more as a feeling than a thought, but the thinking is very much the force behind it I would say. For example, if I start to move my body, or become moved by the music while creating it, I tend to worry, and dislike this, it influences me, disrupts my thinking or decisions and for me this tends to lead to a track that 'at the time' sounded create, but in hindsight after the adrenaline passes, sounds dull and lifeless. This is also why I don't use drugs to make music, but much prefer coffee as this aids my thinking and focus.

Obviously, it is not always a case of copying, or anything that sparks the beginning to create. As regularity has taught me, an upload a day does suggest worries of feeling burnt out, not having anything to say, or any ways left to say it. However, I had come to realise that for someone who like repetitions, copies, the idea of differentiating the identical, arguably and theoretically, I could even try to create the same upload again and again and again. So very quickly being burnt out was nothing to concern myself with.

How I create more technically, that is often what many are curious about, is much like anyone else. I use tools to help me, I read articles or listen to others music to learn. I emulate sounds or styles. I try different listing environments, times of the day, telling people about what I do, or asking there opinion. All these things is what everyone does. There is no secrets or special ways to do something, I just create what sounds good to me, using whatever I feel sounds right both on audio and other.

The Nord Modular is an environment that insists some level of thought. It does create, or at least initially, a division between the machine and the person using it. It can halt creativity as time is needed to think, or manoeuvre and this can be a problem, if allowed to be used as one. For me, this was always the problem, wanting the Nord Modular to be able to be quick and easy like other machines. In actual fact it was my fault, wanting it to be something it wasn't and so a learning to shift my perspective of that machine and what it can provide me was needed. After I could do this, I could use the machine in a way that was both enjoyable and rewarding due to the very thing that caused me problems previously.

When creating something in the Nord Modular, anything goes in terms of the modules it provides. I like to work more systematically than randomly connecting things, but I do like to experiment when something occurs where I don't know what to expect. As is often the case it is a balance between knowing what you are doing, and not…basically bit of luck. Quite often I will do something, and think, 'wow, ok, not sure I understand that but hey, it sounds good'.

Generally speaking I don't re-use patches, I create patch that are more specific that something that can be used to create, like a synth patch or drum machine patch. However, more recently I have started creating such patches to reuse. I wanting to start recognising the habits that would obviously form, and try to break them, allowing things to expand and become more natural, and so far I would have to say it is working.

I would say each upload take apron 2-3 hours, sometimes less and occasionally more. Often when things happen quickly it can be either because it has to, or things just work out that way. Equally when things take a long time, the reasons it does so are much the same.

I create almost all that I do on headphones. I prefer using headphones mainly for the reason that the acoustics in our studio are very reverberant and kept so for the work I do as Mimosa Moize. I don't so much agree that a studio should sound a certain way, but obviously or a certain way of working or sound output, it simply has to. I also like using headphones through what it does to the perception of short or sharp sounds. I prefer, and deliberately create the uploads to have very high dynamics, I like rhythmical sounds loud, and textures deep. On headphones these sounds work differently together than they would on speakers, and I like that difference.

So ultimately I have methods and ideas that are perhaps different to other peoples, but as we all have, they are ways that work for me and perhaps not for anyone else.

I am aware that this post is long, and guests are arriving for this New Years Eve, so I will end this post here. However, if anyone has any questions I am more than happy to answer them in an email and would be happy to hear your thoughts, good or bad :)

I could talk forever, but wont do…and just say thanks to everyone.

Thanks also to everyone who has supported this blog, and hopefully will continue to do so. It has been a long and amazing journey and it is crazy to think this section of this blog is complete. Ok, thats it :)

Happy New Year!
