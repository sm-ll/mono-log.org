A single patch for tonights upload, and through exploring where I left off last night but with a new patch, it produced surprisingly dense sounding results.

I have also in the past played with the idea of crumbling sound, but have yet to really dig into it more than a added texture. Tonight I thought I would push it a little further and what became of this is something of a combination of analogue tape saturation, and digital destruction, almost like a skipping of a cd.

I guess this combination of digital and analogue tape kind of makes sense. A tape when it is work now is basically producing more noise than signal, along with the artefacts that come with this, the tape chewing or stretching for example, causing pitch fluctuations. This is in the patch through adding the noise into pitch and resonance inputs. The CD, a more stepping, squaring of signals, jumping, windowing signals etc, caused perhaps in the patch by the step sequencer, the jumps in signals, and even perhaps the digital nature of the machine all adding something. All this altering its state as the noise moves from white to coloured.

Again, I am surprised by what the Nord Modular can produce, and the simple combination of blocks of sound and the control over it.

On thinking back to last year and the how I worked before beginning this project, I am pleased to say through using this Nord I have changed considerable the way that I work, and actually taking on an approach that is far closer to how I began than what has perhaps come since. Of course, it is all an important stepping stone of constant learning and playing, of which I will never tire.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload.
