## Nord Modular routing.
audio: 15

Firstly, sorry for the slight delay in uploading todays Nord Modular sound, I have been away this weekend doing some recording and taking a break in Wiltshire/Hampshire and only got back late Sunday afternoon, I hope the wait is worth it.

While I was frantically getting ready Saturday morning before we set off, I had the idea while in the shower, the best places ‘for’ ideas, whether or not the Nord Modular would function by routing the outputs of 3-4 in one patch into the left and right audio inputs on another patch, essentially enabling me to link patches together as apposed to only having them run alongside each other. Well, having to wait the majority of the weekend, I was finally able to give it a try once I got home, wondering slightly why I had never tried it before…and well, it works.
