After a single bottle of beer, and little to eat today, combining this with creative work was dangerous to say the least. Its rare, if ever, that I do anything but drink <a href="http://www.hasbean.co.uk/" title="freshly ground coffee" target="_blank">freshly ground coffee</a> while creating, as I am certainly one of those types who needs a hyper amount of concentration to work with any sense, and certainly anything that takes the edge off does not ride well with me when creating.

As my mother would always say “everything moderation”.

Having said that, I stuck with tonights upload and managed to create something that I almost certainly wouldn't have otherwise, having an ever so slight <a href="http://www.synchron.ch/" title="Steinbrüchel" target="_blank">Steinbrüchel</a> quality to the chime-like tones, something I have always loved about his work, amongst other things.

I hope enjoy tonights upload.
