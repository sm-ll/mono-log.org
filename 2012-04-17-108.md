Todays upload is actually one of the calmer sounds I have been creating this evening, feeling the others were even more agressive than what I eventually decided upon. This sound is actually only one small patch that is generating the sounds, with a second for EQ and compressor. Yet again I am dumbfounded by what variety of sounds the Nord Modular can produce.

I suspect the reason for todays sound being such as it is, partly revolves around my choice of music to listen to today, mainly being that of Techno and Mark Fell.

Todays sound also is using some modules on he Nord I rarely use, the Spectral, Formant and Sample & Hold modules. Suffice to say I will be certainly exploring these some more in the coming days, although perhaps in a different way than todayâ€¦we will see.

I imagine todays sound is probably not one for everyone, but hope it is enjoyable all the same.
