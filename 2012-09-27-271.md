## Organ wobble.

A very quick post tonight, apologies to those who enjoy reading what I have to say.

Recently my time has been torn between work and sound creation. Obviously I enjoy the latter more, but one pays the bills betterâ€¦I am sure you have heard this story before.

So for tonight I asked Lucia to help out with the upload while I worked. She has come up with a repetitive organ like sound that I quickly jammed with a little.

Its rough and quickly made, but this is what is reflecting both our time at the moment, something there seems to be very little of these days.

We hope you enjoy it all the same. Thanks for listening.
