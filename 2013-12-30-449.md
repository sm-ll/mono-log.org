Finally I have started on something I have been thinking about for a long time, and that is something inspired by the amazing music of <a href="http://www.silenthillmemories.net/music/sh2_osts_en.htm" target="_blank">Akira Yamaoka</a> used in probably my all time favourite game Silent Hill 2.

I love those chords, and for a long time assumed Akira had created those chords among with all the other amazing sounds, alas he simply used many sample CDs. Read all about it at the <a href="http://silenthillforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=16347" target="_blank">Silent Hill Forum</a>. Still, for me this doesn't take anything away from what is an amazing collection of music, and what goes a long way in making Silent Hill 2 the best game of them all in my mind.

After seeing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZpzS0gfvsg" target="_blank">this video on youtube</a> while looking up Ensoniq equipment, I was reminded that I must start exploring these Silent Hill style chords in the Nord G1, as of yet I have only ever done this (kind of) in the Akai. I have only scratched the surface, with tonights upload being a groovy kind of fun thing, but I will look into this further.

Also tonights upload is using the Nord in a way I mentioned yesterday, in that I am triggering some events through a midi signal, in this case a few kick drums from a specific note. It's only a simple thing, but just playing about with this opens up the possibilities in inspiring the creative part of writing a track. Having sounds that just do their thing, influences how you play them, so lots to look forward to in playing about with that.

Also, I heard recently <a href="http://www.12k.com/" target="_blank">Taylor Deupree</a> is doing something yet again for a once a day project in 2014. He has already previously done a Polaroid a day, and then a field recording a day, now he is going to be doing something with his modular each day. Very excited about this. I believe their will be some appearances from <a href="http://dust.unrecnow.com/" target="_blank">Marcus Fischer</a> who also done a creative project a day for a year. For those of you who don't know, both these guys were hugely influential in me starting my daily uploads, and still to this day there is a massive spike in my stats whenever they have shared or supported this blog. I am obviously massively grateful.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload and if you don't know who is in the picture, then you need to play Silent Hill 2, pronto.
