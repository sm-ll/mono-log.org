## Simple experiments in creation.

Some simple experiments with rhythmical elements this evening, along with a nice sip of Single Malt to relax, although you can't hear that bit, but apologies now if anything doesn't make sense, although I rarely re-read anything before posting, so I imagine it is probably no different than normal :)

I often find that with creating Techno it is ever so hard to get a good combination of sounds to really stand out as interesting. Very easily things can fall into an almost boring combination of sound, one genre that I feel generally being much harder to create gripping examples of, than say in other more abstract experimental music. Although perhaps maybe not boring to a listener once a track is finished, but during the creation process I find there needs to be a very strong and certain combination of sounds to stand the test of multiple cycles of repetition to keep the creator interested. Perhaps this is not strictly true of only this genre, but I feel certainly there are those days where things just don't seem exciting while creating with sound.

A few days ago, Lucia was creating some amazing Techno influenced rhythms, she managed to create a style that was very unique and one that both me and my friend heard slightly in amazement, saying how this particular sound had rarely be used, if at all, in the last 20 years or so of Techno music. This seemed quite incredible, and yet to Lucia's ears, things seemed boringâ€¦haha.

As this was pretty much the first time Lucia had attempted to make more Techno based music, I imagine the process of making itself was of primary focus as she concentrated. I wonder how much the process influences not only the sounds but how we feel about those sounds while we create? 

For me personally, I have generally alway had a better relationship with tracks when things come together very quickly, that with those that take a long time to reach a point I am satisfied.

I experienced an interesting discovery today that I wonder if could be applied to creating sounds and music. I was working on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture" title="IA (information architecture)" target="_blank">IA (information architecture)</a> for a booking portal in a website. A process of inputting details to deliver results based on these details, and those results in turn influencing following options, and so on. Although the system was not overly complex, there was a process of first understanding the bigger picture of the many situations, the agenda or focus in a given sub section of that situation, and so on until a rough understanding of the bigger and finner details of the booking process was worked out. Through a process of working, testing, and re-working, I eventually settled on an IA draft that worked.

The experience came at this point in particular where all of a sudden it seemed so obvious. I felt dumb and couldn't understand why I couldn't find this solution far quicker? why did it take me so long?

I was interested in this experience and so done a bit of reading to find this is a very common feeling when first reaching an IA draft. Even those well versed in this field have this experience time and time again. 

This proposed some questions in how the brain functions, and how the different parts of the brain influence an experience of something as it learns and adjusts.

I am not sure how exactly, but am wondering how this experience can be translated to creating music or sounds? Generally speaking creating music is not a problem, or a problem that I have felt to be mentally similar in anyway, but I do wonder about this.

If anyone has had this experience or similar it would be great to hear it, or even an idea in how this could be used in move creative roles.

I will leave this here for now, but hope to pick up on this another time. Until then, I hope you enjoy this upload.
