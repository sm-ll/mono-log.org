## The rate of change is scary.

Today I have been reminded of how quickly the world or who we share it with can change. Often realisations of change only shake our world into focus when change is challenging, or troubling. Its likely we often fear the idea of change partly due to this experience of it. When our world shakes in a bad way, we fear change, we sit still, we get careful and we get boring.

However, while we might think of how easy something bad can happen to us, we should remind ourselves of how easily something good can happen too. We need to shift our focus onto the good change and the good that can happen from it.

Today was an opportunity for me to make a little good happen, helping someone else's bad day get a little better. An event that could have shook my world horribly ended up shaking it anyway, but this shake came as a prodding reminder from a small index finger. A reminder that said yesterday is too late and tomorrow many never happen. A prod that said today is whats happening right now, and today, and what is done in it, is what counts more than anything else in that world, that world that so easily gets shaken.

I know there are many of your reading this who have something they want to do, something creative, something challenging, a passion, a little crazy, a little silly even. You want to do something but hesitate. You want to change something, inspire someone, support someone or care for someone if they are down. If you have this feeling but hesitate and your reading this and feel a little excited, and little scared even, if your intentions are good ones but are not clear ones, then do it, and do it today.

This is it, this right now, this is what counts.
