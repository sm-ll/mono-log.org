So the story goes like this.

At the weekend I spotted a very nice but v<a href="http://www.dancetech.com/item.cfm?threadid=2652&lang=0" title="ery large Allen and Heath mixer">ery large Allen and Heath mixer</a>, but at a very low and tempting price. Coupled with the sheer size and weight of it, some 47Kg, and the gut feeling I should weight for a Inkel mixer to turn up, I decided, with a little prompting form Lucia, that I should not buy it.

I felt like I had made the right decision.

Today at work, I received a text from a good friend <a href="http://soundcloud.com/james_alaska" title="James Alaska, whose music">James Alaska, whose music</a> you must check out if you haven't done so already.

James mentioned he had spotted a Inkel mixer for sale and thought I might be interested. I looked at the link and although it wasn't the actual model I was after, well it was actually a whole lot better. I couldn't believe my luck.

So today after I finished work me and Lucia travelled down to the far south outskirts of London and picked it up from a very friendly lad who was surprised I was after such a specific mixer. I was equally as surprised to have found one so quickly after learning about them only a few weeks ago.

Well, to cut a long story short, as it is very late here. I returned home at 11:30, and have made something running through this new mixer, as apposed to the horrible little B****ger I hate using. I figured I would run the Nord sketch initially as a dry sound, and then have a little fun with the very nice feature of this mixer.

I think you will be able to tell the sound of this mixer as being very nice indeed. Probably not one for everyone as full of character and not a clean straight signal, but obviously this is why I wanted it so much.

Sorry for the speedy telling of this story, I would love to worm it better, but it is getting very late here in London and I must rest for another day tomorrow.

Thanks again to James Alaska, who has not only been incredibly supportive of this blog, but also very friendly and supportive in general. Especially thank you for finding me such a gem, I really can't thank you enough. You have to come round and play with this mixer soon James.

Enough now of my rambling. 

I hope you enjoy this little ditty.
