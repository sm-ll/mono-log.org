## It's not my neighbour, it's the fridge.

Early this morning at around 6:30AM while I made myself my morning coffee I heard what I thought was my neighbour in the floor below me, playing his music along with its heavy bass, to what I imagined must have been part of his early morning routine. While I wondered how some people are comfortable to play their music at a loud enough volume to be heard by neighbours at such an early hour of the day, I suddenly realised it was not my neighbour after all, but in fact our fridge.

I have decided to use this sound, and the many others that come from our fridge, as a starting point in creating something in the Nord Modular. I worked on the somewhat intermittent bass first, then onto the buzz and high frequencies before tweaking them all too something I liked.
