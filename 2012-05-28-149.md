I very quick post today, so apologies if you enjoy my monologue. 

I do plan on writing a little something thought provoking sometime soon, and now that I have said that I know I will have it in my mind to do so.

Firstly, I have begun archiving a condensed collection over at my <a href="http://soundcloud.com/moize" title="Soundcloud page" target="_blank">Soundcloud page</a> of the uploads. I have only put up the first 31 so far, but will upload more in the near future. It consists of 30 seconds of each, and although very different to the originals, is actually quite a nice listen, not to mention a better way to share with friendsâ€¦perhaps.

Other news is that my partner <a href="http://www.weeld.net/colourofquantum.html" title="Lucia" target="_blank">Lucia</a> has come up with a wonderful idea, that I should play each months upload in a reconstructed live performance, also each month. So I have decided I would like to play live the first week of July, and each subsequent month, a new and uniques to that performance of variations or combinations of that previous months uploads. So if you would like to book me to play, or equally what to be notified when I do play, please feel free to <a href="mailto:martin@mono-log.org">email me</a>, it would be great to hear from you.

I will be performing with my Nord Modular and nothing else, so no laptop, pedals, or any other smaller computers incased in other boxes, other than my Nord Modular. I think this will be a challenge, and for me, thats a big part of what it is all about.

After what has been a scorching hot day, my late night beer is making me a little light headed so I will stop here.

I hope you enjoy the textured upload, and I hope to hear from you soon.
