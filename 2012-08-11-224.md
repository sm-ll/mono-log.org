Probably one of the quickest uploads I have created so far, one of those times when things just seem to come together almost without me doing much. I really wish it was like this more often.

I decided on using one of the <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/nordmodularbook/fmalgorithms.htm" title="FM DX7 algorithm models" target="_blank">FM DX7 algorithm models</a> for the Nord Modular as a starting point, a combination of waveforms, frequency modulation, envelopes and mixing altogether with a little bit of added white noise and chorus. An amazing bunch of patches called <a href="http://nm-archives.electro-music.com/010_NordModular/011_Patches/FM_for_Xmas/" title="FM_for_Xmas" target="_blank">FM_for_Xmas</a>, and well worth checking them out.

I began this upload with patch number seven, but they are all very good, although be careful as the default setting is a very noisy and harsh sound.

Creating sounds like this I am very keen to buy myself a DX7 Synthesizer, certainly one for the list. This list is getting longer and longer.

Tonights upload reminds me of a combination of releases I have loved ever since a young teenager. The main two that stand out are the free giveaway 12" by <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Locust-Needle/release/70786" title="Locust called Needle" target="_blank">Locust called Needle</a>, perhaps my all time favourite record, if not, certainly one of the best I own. Also the work of <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Pete+Namlook" title="Pete Namlook" target="_blank">Pete Namlook</a>, I think it is really the pace and movement that reminds me of his work, more than the sounds, although there are certainly some similarities there also. <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Pete-Namlook-The-Definitive-Ambient-Collection/master/43082" title="Definitive Ambient Collection" target="_blank">Definitive Ambient Collection</a> or <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Air-You-6000/release/7120" title="Air" target="_blank">Air</a> certainly comes to mind. I think both of these will be played tomorrow while I work.

If you haven't heard any of these records, I highly recommend listening to them all, they were played on almost constant repeat by me and friends when younger, and I and friends have painted many a bedroom while listening to this music.

Enjoy.
