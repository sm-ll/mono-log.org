## Rhythm

Last night a good friend round visited whom always introduces me to some great music, with this time being no different. After being recently introduced to the legendary Tim Follin, this particular evening was coming from the likes of a young Ukraine artist, Vakula, and in particular his track ‘Mama Said Go Slow’, the incredible ‘Form Over Function’ by Cosmin TRG and some dirty sounds from Gerry Read. The stand out of the evening for me, was the amazing new works from Fluxion, something I must chase up, perhaps in the form of the Echocord Jubilee Compilation, of what I have heard sounds superb.

It is no surprise after being exposed to such rhythmical delight that todays upload might have a slight rhythmical element to 'its' structure. Without wanting to jump fully into styles of music I have a great deal of time for, and have written in the past for many a year, ie dub-techno/techno, the sounds in todays upload are subtle in their influence and actually have more in common with Frank Bretschneider than those artists I heard last night. 

Having recently learned that Frank also uses a Nord Modular, and did so solely in the collaboration with Tayor Deupree, also using the Nord, on their album Balance. A simple swapping of Nord patches back and forth until Balance was complete.

So today I bring something that is in conversation with many of the previous uploads, but also introduces something new to this daily creative exercise. It is therefore still quite abstract, experimental, light on bass and intensive on the high frequencies…I hope you might enjoy it.
