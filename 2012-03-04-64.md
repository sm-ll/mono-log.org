Todays upload comes as another <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_56/" title="reworking from last Saturdays">reworking from last Saturdays.</a> This upload is perhaps one that is the most similar out of all the variations. Its differences are perhaps in that it is a more focused take on the textures, with tones acting more as carriers of the texture. 

Unlike previous variations, I really can't decide which version I prefer and I must say I really like that. For me, this really demonstrates an importance of similarity and familiarity in creating and listening. I feel originality is not so much the act of doing something that has never been done before, but more the notion of doing something that 'has' been done before and yet making it work.

For me, it is not so much about making or experiencing something as better, but more developing an understanding of the validity of that something.
