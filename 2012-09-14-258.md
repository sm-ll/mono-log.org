## 606 Ticking.

So my Roland TR-606 arrived today. I can't really describe how happy I am that I have this. It was always something that for some reason I thought I would never own again, with my selling of it twice worrying me if I should ever buy another. Well time has passed and new third attempt at owning a 606 is here, and I am very happy indeed.

Long before even deciding on buying one, I knew that the day I have one what the Nord upload would be. I always remembering loving the ticking it makes as the volume pots of the machine are turned up but with no sounds sequenced. This is a perfect example of a difference between a similar sound, and the actual machine.

I have always wanted to do something with this ticking, but never did, until today. I am really pleased I made this Nord upload, and will certainly be doing more like this. 

Its true that many might feel this is a little too simple a thing to do, or its boring, or some other similar comment, for me, these aren't always bad qualities to have and even then are always subjective perspectives. I have never been one who enjoys making things complex for complex sake, and if something simple needs to be done, then it should be done as simple.

Whatever your thoughts, I hope you might enjoy listening to this upload and perhaps ask the question is it enough and why?
