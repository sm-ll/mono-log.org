A nice solid techno track for todays upload and one that reminds me a great deal of Kraftwerk's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBGNlTPgQII" title="Trans Europe Express" target="_blank">Trans Europe Express</a>. This is quite ironic as it was only mentioned today that my music has some similarities to Kraftwerk, which is obviously a huge compliment for me. I think this is possibly due to the use of white noise and raw synthetic sound. 

Thank you Finn for saying such a nice thing :)

I am a huge fan of Kraftwerk's early sound and style. I can't say I am all that fond of their more recent work, but their early stuff was and still is truly some of the best electronic music ever made. Their recent work sounds to me as if they want to sound like the people they inspired, as apposed to simply creating great electronic music.

For me their beautiful electronic sound that is both edgy, rough, and beautifully constructed all at the same time. The patterns and melodies are slightly wonky, tunings slightly off, timing slightly out, volumes uncertainâ€¦yes truly a combination of person and machine working together.

I remember hearing their work firstly through Tour De France, on TV as a young kid, then through MTV using extracts of Music Non Stop, from an album that was perhaps my old time favourite and as new as I can go with Kraftwerk. Radioactivity was my first LP by Kraftwerk that I was lucky to find brand new, tucked away in the back of our local shop, and a record I cherish till this day and consider one of my all time favourite albums ever. The opening of Radioactivity has such an amazing clicking and thud to it, pure electronic sound.

In addition to all this, I always found Kraftwerk's sound to be stripped back to the bare essentials, just enough to create the perfect track, which I consider they did time and time again.

I know how much like Kraftwerk as I go for long spells simply not listening to their music, in fear to over listen. I love the feeling of just dipping into times of Kraftwerk, and judging by them popping up in my everyday a fews time recently, I feel it is well overdue for some Kraftwerk time.

My upload is not even in the same league as Kraftwerk, but I hope you can enjoy it all the same.

Incidentally if you neer found your connection with Kraftwerk, and I have met some who haven't, I urge you to play their music over and over for a few days, you will find your way in and will never look back.
