## Scratchy uncertainty.
audio: 91
---

Recently I have been discussing my daily routine of uploading a sound a day, and have found my perspective of this activity has been to consider it more as a side project to my other work. I am finding however that my days are becoming more challenging with work and yet have been spending a great deal of time on each upload than I feel is perhaps wise. 

It is perhaps as a result of this,  that I have been irregular with the uploads, not that they have ever really been regular, often having the feeling of not having enough time. This will not do.

Through some discussion about these uploads it was suggested that perhaps I limit the time I spend doing them. Up until this point has generally been a case of working on the sound until it feels right, and then settling for it there and no more. By doing it this way I generally feel the sound is where I want it and can basically be satisfied in most cases, however this does create a sense of uncertainty everyday, as to how long it will take this time. Again this will not do.

Also during this discussion, we talked about what is considered as achieving 100%. We generally felt that you can't reach 100% and can only possibly do the best can and therefore it will always fall short of 100%. The consolation being that if your standards are high, doing your best is always going to reasonably good, even if not 100%.

When saying this out loud, this suddenly struck me as problematic and so I attempted a play with words in finding a way to achieve 100% all of the time.

The theory being that if I create something and limit myself to only 2 minutes to create it, I am still achieving 100% whatever the result. Once a result has happened, I have no way of really comparing this result to anything else to establish its quality, as each work is always different and can't be evaluated on anything more that taste using specifics.

In any given situation where we feel we have been compromised, we often say to ourselves as a form of justification of the quality, “well it was the best I could do considering the time I had to do it in”…it is here when thinking about this phrase again, that it is really and quite simply saying, we can only achieve 100%, 100% of the time.

In consideration of this, I have decided to experiment in limiting my creation time for my uploads each day.

Finally, I must say a huge thank you to my lovely neighbours Marley and Pro for this evenings conversation and company, who have been a big inspiration for todays upload, the sounds of a scratchy uncertainty, something that perhaps exists in all creative minds around.
 
I will end this post here, and will see you tomorrow for the beginning of yet another month, and to see how this all works out.

Enjoy todays sound. :)
