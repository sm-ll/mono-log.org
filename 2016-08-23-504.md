Since learning the Space Echo can produce a entirely wet signal (plugging in a dummy jack), I have been wanting to experiment with this using only the tape as a live fx. I've found the delay can be short enough if the rate is as fast as it goes. Suprisingly what delay there is still present competes quite well with computer buffer delay issues, which has some ironry.

I am finding more and more there is a need to leave the laptop out of the studio unless totally essential. Taking it to the studio was becoming a habbit, and preventing me from creating music. For me, it just gets in the way and has unsuable issues occuring far to often. As a result I have resorted back to DAT tape, which is great. I am not sure why I stopped using it, I suppose habbit and illusions of convenience. I may look more at the new digital recorder by Tascam, but i'm startiong to feel my Tascam DAT is doing a good enough job, and will do fine for now. I am quite looking forward to experiencing once again the affects in recording that tape delivers, like having to finish a track as not wanting to waste tape, or the feeling of seeing a shelf full of tapes, oh no, all that space will be usedâ€¦pfft. Somehow, seeing an actual tape and not a file burried in a hardrive, gives me a definite assurance and result of action. The forgettable or hidden file on the computer just doesn't seem to give me the same sense of satisfaction and progress. It's always a 'work in progress'. How I tire of things being left undone.

Today's upload is exploring tape saturation on the Roland Space Echo, and is sequenced by the Phrase Synth on the Atari's Cubase software. I love tapping those atari keys, something solid and definite about them, like the computer had yet to really be more than a few functions, and as a result it seems to have a solid purpose, as apposed to the variety of functions and endless confirgurations today's slimline and light weight machines have. 

I know what I need in the studio, and it's not more options.
