## Lost in sea.

Quite an abstract sound for tonights upload and one that I feel reflects where I am personally these last few days.

There often seems a time where things are in transition, we feel as though we are floating out to sea with no clear guideline to follow back home. The sea seems darker than usual and we sit waiting for daylight to greet us, or perhaps a fixed object in the distance to focus upon to lead us in.

We know there will be a time when we can find our way, but while we wait alone, all seems heightened to the many uncertain sounds we hear in the distance.

The dim light seems to suffocate our eyes as we blink to see our way.
