More simple beat structures for this upload.

I have been really enjoying the simplicity of a few grouped rhythmic sounds and the partnered gaps. It is making for some great fun for me to create, and hopefully as much to listen to.

Today I listened back to some of the previous uploads on shuffle and was reminded of some of the directions these uploads have taken over the 235 days so far. The more I lisen back to these sketchs, the more I feel happy with them and hope to push them in some releasable format in the future.

It reminds me of how much listening back to your own music really helps in finding likeable things with your own creations that you couldn't or would less likely find around the time of creating it, or even at the very time of creating it. I am sure this rings true for many of you who write your own stuff.

My advice today would be to dig out some of your older work, and put it on shuffle, re-contextualise it, and see how you feel about it.

I hope you enjoy todays upload.
