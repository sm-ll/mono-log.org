## Combing headphones.

Yesterday evening I sat and listened to all of the sounds I have uploaded over the past 24 days and for the most part was quite pleased with how everything is going so far. With the exception of a few sounds and certain frequencies being less than ideal, most of it worked for me. I have to say for someone who is perhaps my nastiest critic, it was a rather nice feeling to have.

I did however notice that after listening to them all in order, I needed something more melodic to soften my ears, especially after the recent rhythmical experiments with FM and PM synthesis. 

As a result I’ve decided to revisit a previous patch created for an earlier <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_18/" title="upload">upload</a>, and slightly tweak it, running it through a new comb filter patch I created this morning. I did think to make it a little less ‘comby’, but figured what the heck.

I suppose stylistically todays upload is somewhere similar to the work Taylor Deupree and Christopher Willits have done together in the past, although mine being far more abrasive and busy sound and not nearly as good. A reason for its busyness is partly due to a want to use it for something at a later date. I often make overly full sounding ideas to be able to in turn strip them back, picking out particular frequencies from the many. Very rarely do I feel I make something minimal sounding off the cuff, and generally speaking it is often a process of reduction for me.

Lastly, while looking for a suitable picture this morning, I searched google for pictures of comb’s and found this rather fitting and amusing image of a bold mans comb, a fun novelty sold by <a href="http://www.taylorgifts.com/prodetail~itemNo~30062.asp?utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_campaign=CJ&utm_source=CJ" title="Taylor Gifts">Taylor Gifts</a>…say no more.
