## Familiar sounds, different groove.

Slightly different grooves explored for tonights upload, but holding much in common with some previous uploads in the type of sounds used.

More metal sounding clicks for hats, rattling along in short burst with clusters of drums and bass activity.

I managed to hit on some quite nice raspy bass sounds using FM techniques, that I should really do more of in the future. I always find going through typical cliche Fm sounds a big part of don't use FM all that much, but persistence often pays off in revealing something more subtle.

Enjoy.
