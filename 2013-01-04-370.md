### IS MONEY OUR ENEMY? ###

We are blessed with amazing technology that allows us to connect to others in the far reaches of the world, speaking to them and touching their hearts with our work through the network that is the internet. It really is a wonderful thing.

The internet has brought us closer to realise other things that were once less as easily achievable. For example, setting up as self-employed can now be a far cheaper venture than would have been the previously. All we need now is a laptop connected to the internet, a bit of know how, and we can have something that we can our very own.

However, being self-employed doesn't always mean being able to pay the bills. If we can't pay them, then being self-employed is hardly going to last us long. Our world whether we like it or not generally evolves around money. We need to pay our bills, and if our business is not able to generate money then we have to earn that money elsewhere. As much as I appreciate the power of passion, its not going to keep the landlord happy. So a balance of working two jobs is often the answer, one compensating the other, until ultimately the money starts coming in.

When not earning money, decisions of whether to continue on or not being self-employed are always hovering. As much as you might enjoy the ideal life of being self-employed, do you want it 'that' much to have all this worry and constant uncertainty that comes with it? A real dedication and passion is needed for your venture to continue through these worrying times.

If we keep this in mind, and turn toward the non-profit label, I think we can draw some interesting considerations where money is actually an important motivating force, that is otherwise more often seen as evil when considering creativity.

The non-profit label generally speaking is a label that releases music on free platforms such as digital download or CDR. The workings of a non-profit label go a little something like this. 

The label likes your music and might approach you and offer to release it, and upon agreement uploads it to their website and connecting social network. A more adventurous non-profit might make a small bunch of CDR's to sale at a price that only covers the cost of making them, and also put on the occasional live events, quite often free. It is all very friendly, easing going and often a great way for those starting out to have their music heard and supported within that community.

The non-profit label is very cheap and quick to set up too. Much like becoming self-employed, however unlike being self-employed there are differences. The main difference I see is there is no real need or desire to pay those bills. Unlike many other non-profit organisations who may well work with money but not in generating a profit, the non-profit label functions with little to no outgoings at all. This makes any need to work harder one purely based on passion and belief.

In principle there is obviously nothing bad to say about this.

However, when thinking of how we have to dig deeper when being self-employed, I have to wonder how much passion alone can really provide for the label and artists involved? Although having music supporting by a non-profit label is better than nothing, are we doing enough?

This is a very complex and difficult area to write about, but I feel the main concern is to do with labels acting responsibly, and doing more to promote and ensure the artists have a fruitful future. Being a solid and ongoing platform for developing their needs and supporting their goals.

Speaking from experience, having nobody download a track, to having stacks of records piled up in the corner of the studio, present very different perspectives of what is often considered the same world. However, I have to say I believe they have a very different worlds.

So is passion alone enough to drive a label to keep going? Can passion alone be enough to develop the label and its artists?

Is the combination of a free website, free facebook page, free to cheap digital downloads, all with virtually no outgoings what we are now calling a label? And if it is, is this actually always a good thing?

A joke I have often heard is that an artist could write a track Sunday night, and have it 'released' Monday morning. The same could be said about setting up a label.

It does beg the question of just because something is easy to do,  does this mean it should always be done?

Speaking from the perspective of the artist, if there is no money going into the pot, no payment from the label, no money to manoeuvre that label, then really is the creation and output of this music really only of that of the hobby?

If we remember how hard it is to be self-employed and maintain a second job to pay the bills, then considering this our creative output is really renagated to only a few mere hours in the evening or weekends. This again sounds like a hobby to me.

So, is the result of less and less time and money invested into something always a good thing for its future?

Are the new listeners who are exposed to music that is made faster and cheaper learning they also can make their music faster and cheaper? and if so what is going to happen to the quality of this music, what is the consequence of this?

If this can only be a hobby for the artists, a product of spare time, then is the non-profit label actually a label at all? 

Is it a label or a hobby?

Is it through the very idea of non-profit being something that can now begin with little to no money at all, causing such repercussions that many artists decide in starting their very own labels?

If thinking of money as a partner or supporting role to the sustainability and development of the label, its artists, and the creative output, even a non-profit label could function within its morals. The non-profit label could not only provide releases on better quality formats, provide better promotion, better affiliation, better artists, but also pay their artists.

For what is often seen as an evil or detrimental burden on creativity, I ask that the very lack of embracing money responsibly is perhaps why we find many incredible artists not only un-supported, but also not paid.

Is it not time more was done in ensuring the future of electronic music is a healthy and vibrant place for generations to come.
