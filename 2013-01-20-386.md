## A sound of a different kind.
audio: 386

Todays upload is a sort of collaborative effort, but of a kind I have never tried before. Firstly my partner <a href="http://smallmimosa.wordpress.com/" title="Lucia created her own upload for her blog">Lucia created her own upload for her blog</a>, which I then used in attempting to guide me in creating my own upload. Both of these uploads could then be played along with each other, although obviously you don't have to, its entirely your choice. Lucia's post and upload is called <a href="http://smallmimosa.wordpress.com/2013/01/20/a-small-spin/" title="a small spin">a small spin</a>.

Given the nature of the sounds Lucia created, it was very hard to come up with something that would fit, and so I needed something that would give me some flexibility and able to quickly change sounds to work. I thought I would use this chance to create something in the Nord Rack 2 and not the Nord Modular.

The Nord Rack 2 has a great deal of similarities in its sound to the Nord Modular, although perhaps a little more agressive and typical more synth like. Having used it for many years, although neglected more recently, I was able to use it in a different way to what I had done those many years ago, and create something quite different as a result.

Today I remembered I am able to run four sounds at the same time much like the Nord Modular, and so might consider using the Nord Rack 2 for the occasional upload. I am sure you wont mind.

Lucia has been also <a href="http://smallmimosa.wordpress.com/" title="creating a tune a day at her own blog">creating a tune a day at her own blog</a>, and it is already sounding incredible as you would expect. I am quite confident she will keep it up and complete a whole year, and considering the standard of sounds already, I can't begin to imagine what things will sound like come December time. Please drop by Lucia's blog <a href="http://smallmimosa.wordpress.com/" title="A Small Tune">A Small Tune</a>, and support her all you can. 

Lucia tends to be quite nervous about her creations and so I really hope this gets easier for her, as her ability to craft with sound is incredible. Many of the sounds and creations in <a href="http://www.mimosamoize.com/" title="Mimosa Moize">Mimosa Moize</a> were directed and perfected by Lucia, which I believe you can hear in some of her uploads. Additionally <a href="http://www.weeld.net/colourofquantum.html" title="her solo work">her solo work</a> often has a much harsher but delicate noise quality to it, which I rarely hear in anyone else. I hope she gets the support she deserves.
