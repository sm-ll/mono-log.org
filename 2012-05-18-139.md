## A static process.

Todays upload is the result of further experiments in how I approach the patch design in the Nord Modular. I have found from experiencing some patches created by other Nord Modular users, and remembering those I created back at the beginning of the year, it is during that learning phase that perhaps the most unexpected connections occur, and through learning my way around the Nord Modular, there is the possibility habits form.

Habit forming is something of a double edge sword in many respects, obviously being good versus bad habits. I think for me the important thing is finding that balance, but perhaps more important than that is realising the habit as it is forming, and finding ways to use this habit forming to stimulate pockets of innovation, and to build a sort of knowledge bank of possibilities.

I often create associations with things, and these associations can form in all sorts of places, influencing my perspective. I certainly find this within the Nord Modular, existing for me a strong sense of association with certain modules, and certain connection configurations of them. This association doesn't just end simply at the sound, but also artists, genres or eras that this sound output might resemble. This familiarity of the sound is also influenced by what I might associate at any one time during its creation, and knowing that the creation period itself hugely influences my perception of the sounds also, so when time away from these sounds can occur, my perception of the sounds and the associations I make all change.

Recently I was trying to think of releases that use the Nord Modular extensively, and although hearing its use in many tracks, for me I felt the release by<a href="http://www.discogs.com/Taylor-Deupree-Polr/release/16931" title=" Taylor Deupree entitled Polr" target="_blank"> Taylor Deupree entitled Polr</a>, stood as the best example of its use. I have learned this album actually use no Nord Modular in it at all, and in-fact another Modular system entirely. No sooner did I hear this news, I was sort of able to think back to its sound in my mind, and make sense of this, almost reordering what I understood as these sounds and making new associations, dramatically changing its sound. I have yet to listen to this album since learning of the tools used in its creation, but am looking forward tremendously to hearing it once again with this new understanding.

If you haven't heard this album, I highly recommend tracking a copy down if you can, it comes in the beautiful static bags that <a href="http://www.raster-noton.net/" title="Raster-Noton" target="_blank">Raster-Noton</a> used for their Static Series.

As always I hope you enjoy todays upload, and perhaps can make your own associations with its sound.
