Still feeling very ill today, actually worse than I did yesterday, o well. 

Hopefully I will get better soon, and as people say I will appreciate my heath more.

Enjoy this short little sound. It reminds me a little of the days when I first starting making music with computer software, creating simple tones and clicks.

Enjoy.
