## Quirky.

A bit of a strange one for tonights upload, a combination of strange synth sounds and an unusual balancing of them.

It has a sort of old skool electronic feel to it with the spluttering melodies that I kind of like, with whispering raspy melodies contrasted with loud crunching percussion like sounds. It certainly has its charm and so I am happy to share it.

I have always preferred my rhythms to be much louder than anything else, both to emphasise the pattern but also to create a sense of space around the sounds. I very much like large dynamics within a track, and is a main reason I struggle with much of todays more typical and what I regard as commercial sounding electronic music, a sound that is rammed to the hilt with sound, compressed and limited like an iron press has squashed all the life out of it.

Anyway, small rant over :)

I hope you enjoy.
