## DRM1 MKIII

So the last handful of days me and my partner (Lucia) have been looking through various pieces of studio gear, tempting by many things.

Among the many mediocre, emulations and simply poor quality bits of kit available these days, there seem a few pieces that we keep coming back to.

For me this has to be the Vermona DRM1 MKIII Analogue Drum Synthesizer. I feel there are a few reasons why I keep looking at screen shots and listening to various you tube clips of it, forever tempted.

The first has to be its design.

It might be a bit odd to want something that make sound based on its look, surely it should be its sound right? Well yes and no. Obviously it needs to sound good, but I am a believer of that if it looks great it probably sounds even better than what might be first appreciated. It often takes time to get into a new synth or sound making machine, and the design is often the thing that carries a user along, coming back to it again and again until they find a way or get what the creators may have wanted of their ideas and dream put into the machine. 

The second is the sound.

I am not so sure of its sound, it kind of sounds odd, unusual, doesn't sound like much else, and I think it is these things combined that make it a desire of mine. I tire of the machines that sound 'like' a 909, or 808 or whatever, and have always wished the emulations did more to bring that idea further than spend their time making emulations that are so close, they end up being compared on authenticity, which is a really odd way of listening. 

The Vermona seems more about creating new drum sounds, and I wonder if that is the reasoning of calling it a Drum Synthesizer, a subtle choice in wording but one that reminds me of more a mind set in creating, synthesising new sounds more than emulating old ones. I feel the whole interface is crying to explore new drum sounds and if the you tube clips are anything to go by, many people are making some very unusual drum sounds.

Unusual is good in my book. Electronic music used to sound unusual to my ears, not a constant reminder of its past but a thought to its future. I hope this returns.

I think this Vermona DRM1 MKIII might well be an early gift for myself. I have already heard one through a Space Echo, a machine I used to own, loved and miss dearly having sold it. I am very keen to get some of these bits back and can feel the list is refining to a select few bits of kit.

Todays upload comes from this thinking of slightly more experimental drum sounds, and further explorations into some pattern ideas and sounds form previous uploads.

I hope you enjoy it.
