Todays upload is experimenting with high rate LFO signals used as audio signals. My main purpose for this being that I can have far more tones running together than I could have with audio signals. 

Although the quality is much lower using LFO's, I wanted to explore that lower quality, specifically in the higher frequency range. I have found the quality of sound is more than usable, being far softer sounding with some interesting micro textures.

I think tomorrow I will do something again using the LFO's, although perhaps a little more complex than todays chord.
