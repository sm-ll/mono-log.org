## Changes.

Todays sound passed through many changes before finally coming to what I am sharing today. Initially, I started with a recording I made this morning from my studio window for inspiration and direction, after being reminded of the din and drone that is the London sound, against experiencing the quiet of Silbury Hill and Winchester over the weekend. The final result in actual fact, is perhaps more closer to the idea of 'quiet noise' than any drone or London soundscape, and probably eventually took more inspiration from my partners track <a href="http://www.dragonseyerecordings.com/catalogue/de6010.html" title="‘A Broken Field IV’">‘A Broken Field IV’</a>  found on the recent compilation ‘Iron’ released on Dragons Eye Recordings.

In working with the Nord Modular, I have found that patches reaching more and more complexity, tend to result in sounds that only worsen to my ears. Sounds seem overworked and busy with information. Looking at the patch I also have a similar impression, with patch cords everywhere and far to many options, things seem visually poor and unsatisfactory. I much prefer to clearly see what is doing what, with such a simple patch in this amazing synth delivering a far richer and more interesting sound to me ears.

There is definitely a point at which there is always a need to strip back and reduce the complexity of the patch to ensure something clean and simple in design is evident in the sound also. Today’s sound, although very simple, had a mass of patch cords stretching every which way, and although this is obviously almost impossible to hear from just the sound, and neither should it really matter, for me knowing it 'is' there I can almost feel it as I listen to the sound and can’t help but find this slightly off putting. It reminds me of bad wiring, lazy coding or bodged DIY.

Still, it is an enjoyable learning experience all the same and with time, I am sure I will forget the spaghetti wiring and the overly complex nature of the patch, to simply enjoy the sounds only, as I hope will everyone else.
