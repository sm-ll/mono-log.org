A really special upload for today and one that will hopefully excuse the lateness of it being uploaded. 

After a long day being away from my computer, I arrived home to talk over Lucia's work and share a nice cool Asahi beer with her. Time past quickly, as it often does when we spend time with each other, and the day slipped by without us even noticing it, and soon it was the early hours of the morning.

With both of us feeling very tired and slightly numbed from our Asahi, and my upload not having been done, we decided to sit together at the Nord Modular and create something very quickly together.

With high frequencies and a hint at the ambient noises in our studio and outside our studio window, I think it is clear to hear Lucia's influence on todays sound.

I hope you enjoy todays sound, and perhaps can join us for a cool beer into the early hours by listening to it.
