## Chord, bass, fuzzâ€¦ it's dubby

Today's upload is using the Akai S2800 and its built in Sine waveform for bass, and the Nord Rack 2 for some chord based sounds, all wrapped in fx and hiss.

There is something really great about the Akai S2800, and it is very tempting to buy some other Akai models, as unlike software based sampling tools, the Akai sampler delivers something really unique and subtle in its sound. But it doesn't end there, also the way it limits how you work with it, also produces a overall sound that really stands out if you know what to listen for.

I can see many of these upload will be exploring the Akai even more. Despite own it for some 18 years now, I still have more digging to do.
