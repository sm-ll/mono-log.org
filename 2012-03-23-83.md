## Tranquil pulse.

Todays upload comes from further attempts at recreating the <a href="http://www.create.ucsb.edu/PulsarGenerator/index.html" title="PulsarGenerator">PulsarGenerator</a> in the Nord Modular, which although I am certain is unachievable, it is nice to try and see by how much it is unachievable.

Really it is a question of accuracy and limitations on the part of the Modular that means it can't quite get where it needs to be in terms of sound, although I feel these attempts have created some interesting results, todays being one of them. Todays upload is a much calmer sound compared to all the pulse style uploads so far, so I am pleased.

Enjoy.
