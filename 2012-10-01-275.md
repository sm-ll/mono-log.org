Really enjoying making this one tonight. A creation that comes after being quite frustrated at my poor Supercollider programming skills. :)

Perhaps a future daily creation is in order?â€¦actually perhaps not, haha.

For tonight this one is again coming from a single patch, using and finding a few new techniques to do with sending inverted information using the LevMulti1 module. I think I might have actually done this before, but today it has cemented it that little further.

I really would love to make a boinging delay line, and might well have a sit down over the next few days to see if I can get something close, although I am doubtful I will succeed.

Still, something interesting always comes out of trying something else, and tonights upload is perhaps a result of that too.

My frustration has gone, and I am ready for another day.

Enjoy.
