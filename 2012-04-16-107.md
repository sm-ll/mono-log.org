Firstly sorry for the late hours of this post, my sleep pattern is a little out of shape at the moment after my time away at the weekend, hopefully it will be back to normal soon this week, still I suppose this upload might still be Monday for some of you.

Todays upload is exploring some of other modules in the Nord Modular, namely the Spectral Module. Recently I have been focused on making enjoyable uploads more than learning, although it is all learning really, but I felt it would be nice to included some that explore the synth a little more again.

Very quickly I have found using some similar techniques as in previous uploads but with the Spectral module a higher frequency clicking occurs that what I have found with some of the others. High frequencies is something I have found more difficult to achieve in the Nord Modular than in others way that I might use in other synthesis methods, the Nord having a much softer or perceived softer sound although still quite highâ€¦not entirely sure why that is at this point, perhaps mainly due to the synths bit rate or something similar, I will have to look in the manual at the spec sheet again.

I am quite pleased and surprised by this sort of high clicking texture achieved in what is otherwise quite a straight forward pattern, and will be looking into this modules potential further in future posts, it certainly sounds promising.

I have also read that it has been removed from the G2 Nord Modular, which is a shame if it has, still, a reason to have both the G2 and the G2 I suppose, although really any reason to have the both is good in my book :)

I hope you enjoy tonights upload, and again apologies for it arriving a few hours later than the normal.
