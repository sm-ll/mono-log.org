## The MIDI Processor and the Red box
---

One synthesiser I used extensively back in 2000 was the Nord Rack 2. At the time I was still sequencing my gear with the Atari STE running Cubase, and the Nord Rack got explored in depth due to midi control on everything. I didn't switch to audio based software, initially on Windows 98, until a little bit later. I remember the transition to a more computer based approach being a difficult one for me. The Nord Rack 2 slowly got put aside during the computer phase, being used less and less until it almost got sold along with my Nord Modular. Luckily my girlfriend at the time threatened to leave me if I sold either. That girlfriend is now my wife. Lucky guy.

Back at the end of 2013 I brought the Atari STE and Cubase back into my studio, but unlike back in the 90's, this Cubase come with a manual, a big binder in-fact.

I tend not to read manuals all that much, and typically for me I tend to miss some pretty obvious stuff sometimes. I often find myself wishing a piece of equipment does something I believe it can't, until I think this long enough to double check in the manual, often realising I was wrong. 

This has happened again.

While flicking through the Cubase manual for keyboard shortcuts, I stumbled upon a module I had pretty much forgot about called 'The MIDI Processor'. I vaguely remember playing about with it as a teenager, but typically for me at that time, anything that required dipping into computers was incredibly boring. It has only been through a combination of choice and necessity that I have ended up not only using computers more, but earn a living coding on one.

I know many of the uploads on this blog come from the Nord Modular, but if I had to pick a favourite of the two, it would be the Nord Rack 2 for sure. Don't get me wrong, I love the Nord Modular, but it's always struck me as a sort of intense and intelligent friend, that although you love them dearly, sometimes, not even all the caffeine in the world can get you in the mood for that conversation. 

Today's upload explores the MIDI Processor, partnered with an old friend I can relax with, and one I know we will be hearing more from, the Nord Rack 2.
