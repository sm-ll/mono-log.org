## Sink in cord.

Tonights upload is slightly longer than normal, hitting nearly 7 minutes. It is a minimal, dense groove that seems to sink in more than want to be listened to. 

Possibly one that works good on headphones, although I create all these uploads on headphones, if not I imagine loud is always good :)

On occasion when doing these uploads I seem to find that mood where things seem to get the blood flowing that little bit more than normal, and tonights hit that mark for me, and I am pleased.

It could be the Friday night in the air or my excitement of whats to come in 2013, or even a new realisation for me after watching a short clip of Moritz von Oswald that open my eyes once again to something that has been starting back at me all this time.

Perspective strikes once again. :)

I hope you have or are enjoying your evening, and thanks for listening once again.
