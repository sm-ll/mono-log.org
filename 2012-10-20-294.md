Tonight me and my partner Lucia went to watch <a href="http://www.cafeoto.co.uk/ursula-bogner-jan-jelinek-andrew-pekler.shtm" title="Andrew Pekler and Jan Jelinek play Ursula Bogner: Sonne = Blackbox at Cafe Oto.">Andrew Pekler and Jan Jelinek play Ursula Bogner: Sonne = Blackbox at Cafe Oto.</a>

Well, it was amazing, as could be expected.

This is the first time either of have seen them play, and especially in the case of Jan Jelinek, its been a long long time coming. Very happy.

So, as for tonights upload, I thought I couldn't resist putting something quickly together that shares some similarities to what I heard tonight. Obviously it goes without saying that tonight was a million miles better than my upload, but I thought it woud be fun. Consider the sound of their performance I have had to run the Nord through the built in delay on the Inkel Mixer, to give it that retro sound. At least you can get to hear the Inkel a little more as a result.

Enjoy.
