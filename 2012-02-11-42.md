## Drawing out the quiet.
audio: 42
---

A difficult morning with sounds not behaving, still that is the nature of the beast.

Todays upload being the penultimate sound to be used in working on me and my partners live performance in Canada in March, I think considering this am how we tend to work with sounds past this initial creation stage, todays upload lends itself well to further tweaking from Lucia, or perhaps myself too.

With todays sound I attempted to draw out the noise of the Nord, trying to get at its circuits and see if it whines or purs. I think it is more a hisser, but still, I think I might continue to dig and see what can be found.

As a result, this sound today is a muffled and rattly texture, and something as I say, hopefully will work well as the sound of <a href="http://www.mimosamoize.com/" title="mimosa|moize">mimosa|moize</a>…we will see, or rather hear. It also uses yesterday granular patch effort as a second patch, to run the sounds through, a patch I think I might work further on.

Incidentally, if anyone who is reading this and would like to get in touch who hasn't done so already, please do, I would love to hear your feedback. I haven't put a commenting section on this blog in fear of it taking away to much of my time, although I am still considering it. My email is at the top of the page.

In addition to that there is a nice thread over at the <a href="http://www.12k.com/forum/index.php?topic=880.0" title="12k forum">12k forum</a>, well there are many nice threads there, but this one in particular is to do with the G1 and G2 Nords, sharing patches etc…so if your interested do stop by, and why not <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/shop/" title="buy some cd's">buy some cd's</a> while your there, some of which I have mentioned in previous posts, its all good so…enjoy :)
