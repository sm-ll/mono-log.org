## Beating beats.

More experiments with similar beating ideas following on from yesterdays upload, only this time using LFO's as triggers of more snappier rhythmic sounds.

I also thought to also experiment with using some more challenging sounds, attempting to find a new but familiar route. 

I have to say I am looking forward to hearing some of these recent uploads myself at the weekend, and ideally give them more time to sink in and consider.

Hopefully these experiments are as equally enjoyable as they are quirky.
