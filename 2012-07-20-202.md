Some shuffle chords patterns for Friday nights upload, not the result of any particular plan but really just the result of playing about. Its a bit sketchy, actually a lot sketchy but I suppose it has a charm to it.

I have always enjoyed working with sounds filtered down very low, and rarely would I change frequencies as sequences play, but tonight I thought I would have a little fun, maybe because it is Friday night…well Saturday morning now, or maybe that late night Single Malt just pushed me into party mode, or more likely sleep mode now I am knocking on 34 next Thursday.

Still, however old you are today, or whoever old you feel today as it might well be Saturday morning for you…I hope you enjoy it all the same :)
