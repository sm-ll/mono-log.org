### What is piracy today?

Is downloading something illegally to only decide whether or not to buy it considered piracy today? Is the uploading, listening and sharing of You-tube music/videos considered piracy today? Is the ripping of CD's, or recording of records you didn't buy, placed into your iTunes considered piracy today? Is the recording of a live event with your mobile camera, to upload and share it later considered piracy today? Is the sharing of illegally obtained music with someone who then goes on to buy this music considered piracy today? Do any of these sound familiar?

The act of piracy was begun the moment we were able to record for ourselves. With the invention and embracing of the internet in our society, sharing at its core, the distinction of piracy and sharing is blurred for many. 

### The morality.

As is often the case we try to justify some of these, or all depending, on some basic set of principles we have decided upon. As in many laws and regulations there is a definite right and wrong, but also a subjective area that allows for some interpretation based on the specifics.

Using or abusing (depending on your perspective) this area is explored. We might make all manor of justifications for our actions that some will agree on, and others do not. The distinction of what is actually right or wrong is supported or not based, on the community you put yourself in. There are, and I have heard the stories, some of us that truly believe music should be free for everyone. That it is their belief to purchase and then share illegally this music for others.

While there are those who share as radical an idea as the rest of us around the rights and wrongs of sharing, of piracy today, we are always going to be surrounded in piracy. This is pretty obvious. To me, piracy shouldn't be eradicated no more than it should be applauded. It is, after all, a matter of perspective, as were the creation of the laws to battle it. Do I like the idea of piracy, no I don't, but I don't need to like something to be able to see the importance of it.

### A perspective.

I have a perspective that is not particularly in favour of stopping anything. If people are doing something, it is because they want to, and as someone who likes the idea of being able to do things, wanting to stop them would seem a bit contradictory. Having said that, I do appreciate the perspective that through those that are doing something I would not, it allows me to think of ways to react to that action. An action that is more about doing something else, than stopping something being done.

I am not a law, or wish to be a law. Law is in itself only another form of piracy, a point of view justified, a view that varies from place to place. I do not know the answer to piracy, yet. I do think though we could begin in attempting to ask better questions. Questions that focus more on what we can create, than what we should stop. To do something that is not about stopping something, but starting something.

Would we steal from those who we know would only steal in return? Could we stand asking for money for our art knowing we would never pay for art ourselves? Would we fight against piracy if it actually helped us?

### The Upload.

Tonights upload is a re-working of the patch created <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/blog/snd_35" target="_blank">this time last year</a>. The reason I chose this upload is mainly to do with what <a href="http://smallmimosa.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/perfectly-together-and-separated-also/" target="_blank">Lucia is doing over at her blog</a>. Go there to read more.

I hope you enjoy this version of the upload, a more bass heavy and more fitting recent style I feel.
