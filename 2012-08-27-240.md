Some more experiments with space, pattern and pitch detuning for tonights upload.

I feel there is certainly a style developing that both borrows from many of the influences I have mentioned previously, and yet also stands as something quite new and exciting for me.

This one seems to have a more mid to lat 90's techno vibe to it as apposed to some of the other more obvious dub-techno sound. It reminds me of Surgeon or Joey Beltram in some small way.

The stuttering sound reminds me of times past creating with midi, and when stopping the sequencer the synths would ring out, continuing on a little while, playing odd notes as they seemed to settle down off the last remaining midi information sent. 

I always liked this sound and was forever starting and stopping the sequencer to hear this affect over and over. At the time I never had the courage to record enough of this sound or perhaps think of it as standing as a track of its own right. I remember enjoying it for its simplicity and the condensing of all the relevant frequencies needed for a track, but to be heard all at once. 

My thinking being that if the frequencies are used to bring some sort of familiarity or stability to the listener, then really the track could do anything. I feel I stil use this thinking till this day.

I can see there will be many more of these stutting, start-stop style creations as I am really enjoying this sound. 

I hope you are enjoying them as much as I am creating them.
