A ragged dub groove for tonights upload.

Again I have used some of my new toys within the creation of the tracks, and as you can hear when these effects drop out half way through, how much they influence the nature of the sound that is creating in the Nord Modular.

I can't say I have ever been a fan of working with effects in order to just add something, but more as a sound just like any other, a part of the sound.

This upload begins my thinking further in some ideas of using effects on tracks, but more in a complete rework of the sounds put as a remix of an original, a wet mix perhaps? I have yet to try it out completely, but feel quite excited by the possibilities.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the upload.
