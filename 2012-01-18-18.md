Todays sound began out of using the same notes found on the open strings of a tuned guitar. I wanted to created something that had similar to that of my previous guitar experimentation, holding a more melodic shape to the sound. I also decided to approach the creating of this sound in a similar way to how I worked with sampled based music back in 2002-2004. 

Obviously with the Nord Modular not having sampling available, I attempted to create a sound in one patch that I could use as a sort of loop based sample, linking it to another patch to further sculpt it, taking some inspiration from the language evident in using and processing samples.

Using my previous finding of routing one patch through into the external inputs of another, sides steps the cpu maxing out, allowing me to use certain cpu hungry modules with a little more flexibility. But another advantage of this is the splitting of the patches into more separate and dedicated functions, such as sound sources, filtering, EQ, etc. I think in the future I might consider creating specific building blocks to further this connecting of the patches, allowing me to quickly grab and route with further ease. Using the Nord in this more predetermined way as apposed to just simply exploring, has been a really interesting way of working, insisting I use the right modules in certain ways to get what I want. This approach so far has been far more time consuming, with todays sound taking some nearly 4 hours to get to the stage it is at now.

Another added benefit of using the Nord Modular this way, and in particular the reusing of these building blocks, is a similarity that 'might' form over the different sounds that are created. With similarity comes the forming of bond and confidence I feel, which soon forms the language of creation and perception.

I very much like the idea of creating many almost identical sounds, as for the biggest part of my creative life I have always worked towards a total opposite, creating very different sounds and styles time and time again. Although this is absolutely fine, I have come to appreciate the huge array of variation that can appear in what is initially and quite incorrectly thought as almost identical. I would go so far as to say when presenting something that is new and original, the tendency is to find the similarities to something else. If when presented something that is 'supposed' to sound identical, I can believe our efforts will be put to finding differences all of a sudden.

Lastly, I just want to quickly mention the photo I have specifically picked for todays post comes from <a href="http://m-eymeymey.tumblr.com/" title="someone">someone</a> who has been inspiring me since her finding me on facebook. I do not know who this person is but it is always a joy to see what and how she presents her work and findings. I think this photo is no longer on <a href="http://m-eymeymey.tumblr.com/" title="her tumblr">her tumblr</a>, so I am pleased I got a copy when I did.
