## Wandering thoughts.

Some resonant, wandering tones, textures and thoughts today, perhaps its the heat.

This is a slight variation on yesterdays sounds and although quite different I feel it still shares some obvious similarities.

Often when creating these sorts of sounds happy accidents can occur that really set one sound from another. I often find that to be able to reach a special moment, it is often more a case of doing something again and again until that magic happens, than managing to create it on request. And yet when it does happen, it often is so instantaneous and almost effortless.

I can't say I am convinced of a special moment in todays upload, but more and more I am aware of how this daily upload constantly challenges my feelings of good and bad. How my negative and positive feelings have a huge affect on my relationship with each upload, while creating it and when listening back.

The whole effort of having to actually put something out there on a daily basis really doesn't get any easier, and actually becomes harder with each day.

Today I received a lovely email from someone who was trying to find something of the community that was formed around the Nord Modular. I was thrilled to hear of their joy in finding this blog during their search, and within the email they urged me to keep it up. I am sure I will manage to see this project through to the end, but this encouragement was certainly at the perfect time. There was even a point where I even thought to carry this project on yet another year, although I think having got this far I can safely say that this most probably wont happenâ€¦haha.

It is times like this when receiving such a positive message from someone I don't know, that urges me to not only continue, but to always use this chance to make the most of it. I am still ensure of what making the most of it is, and perhaps my understanding of it will only come at the end, when I can understand it as something complete. 

I guess one thing I have definitely learned, is that doing is not as obvious as it sounds. To do is really just the act of getting the ball rolling. Doing is most certainly the first step, and once you can begin to do something then often things will just happen from that doing. There is also a certainty, a feeling of knowing when something is right or not, and until you do something then everything is so abstract there is real knowing for sure of anything.

I guess in my confusing ramble the point I am trying to make is this. If you feel like you would like to do something, and have yet to do it, then stop thinking about it and just start doing it right now. And even if you stop almost as soon as you started, at least you did that, which is more than not starting at all.
