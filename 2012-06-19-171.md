## Vladislav connection.

Today someone mention often being reminded of other peoples a sound within my uploads, a sort of connection through experience. The interesting part for me is where in particular we draw upon these connections hugely influences our experience of what we hear. It brings back that fun notion we all would have thought of as a child when learning about our sense, where we wonder what we hear is the same as someone else.

If I take the album <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Taylor-Deupree-Polr/release/16931" title="Polr by Taylor Deupree" target="_blank">Polr by Taylor Deupree</a> for example, an album I blindly or rather deafly decided to myself was created on a Nord Modular. I had a certain experience of modular sound creation and used that to asume certain things. I assumed when it was written, which coincided when Taylor was certainly using a Nord (another assumption) and therefore judging by how the sounds were constructed, the audible process, the restrictions informing the music, I assumed it was Nord Modular. It isn't.

Since learning the actual machine used to create this album, I listen to it now and I am slightly bemused how I could have not noticed. Yet when I really think about it, I think I probably did. I remember thinking about sounds having a sharper, edgy hardness to them, that I can't say I have ever heard in a Nord Modular. And yet I sort of insisted in my mind this was what it must be created on.

Another thing that was brought to my attention was the use of certain equipment to make certain sounds, and that the Nord Modular seems so flexible in creating all sorts of sounds. As I often say, I am just surprised as the next person at what this amazing red box can create. My thinking of this is, much in the same way we might associate one machines sound to a whole album or artist, I think we do exactly the same when we go to create with a machine. Its as if the Nord or whatever it is we chose, has already decided how we must use it due to our experiences of it through our own use and the use of others. It insists, as did I with Taylor's Polr, that it must be so.

I believe that through using my Nord Modular every single day, creating only with it and nothing else, my experience of this Nord Modular, and this particular one, mine that is, is changing through experience. Even through listening back to sounds that I 'thought' where certainly a particular style, I am constantly challenged with my perception and memory of these sounds in constant flux. It comes to periods now that I don't know what one thing will sound like from one day to the next and generally have little time to think to much about it, before I have to make another one.

This brings me to todays upload.

I have decided to create something using my brief and generally uninformed experience of <a href="http://www.vladislavdelay.com/" title="Vladislav Delay" target="_blank">Vladislav Delay</a>. Vladislav is an artist I have known of his influence since hearing him first during the whole <a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Mille%20Plateaux" title="Mille Plateaux" target="_blank">Mille Plateaux</a> boom, and yet as often is the case he was an artist I never bought a release by. Perhaps it was the freedom of his sounds or the uncertainty of style, I really don't know. So my experience of his sound is lesser than other artists I have followed. For some reason I feel the best description of this would be for comic collectors, and what superhero they may buy stories of.

So tonights upload is using my experience of Vladislav Delay, in wonder of how this might sound in the future, how this might sound to those who know his sound well, and ultimately another way to push something interesting out of the Nord Modular.

This is one patch again, trying to create a sort of delaying, crunching and unstable sound. It feels unstable to me, and the patch looks unstable to me tooâ€¦very unlike me I must say. I feel like I need to iron it to flatten out the edges.

I hope you enjoy it.
