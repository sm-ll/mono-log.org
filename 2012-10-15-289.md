I am in that weird phase of being ill, where everything seems slightly detached. Senses are confused and temperature is higher than normal. My dreams have become challenges of organising colour, code, and all calculated along with how easy it is for me to swallow.

I am probably the biggest wuss when it comes to being ill, I mean I can work through it, but I really dislike it. Obviously nobody does, but when you can't do the things you love the way you would like to because your not feeing right, it gets quite frustrating.

Its both having enthusiasm and focus to create, and judgement and patience to listen. Both a struggle when ill I find.

It makes me think again about my health, and what life might be like as I get older. I can't say this is something I have much thought about up until now.

The upload I think shows I am getting better, it seems more focused, but also a little frustrated and slightly clumsy. I think this must be a good sign, and I am eager to wake up tomorrow, hopefully feeling much better.

I feel I owe you all some good uploads.

Thanks for listening.
