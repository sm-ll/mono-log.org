Todays upload is the result of some experimenting triggering envelopes controlling sine waves to give a similar result or texture to those found in say software like <a href="http://www.create.ucsb.edu/PulsarGenerator/index.html" title="PulsarGenerator" target="_blank">PulsarGenerator</a> or perhaps sharing some similarity with previous uploads.

Although PulsarGenerator has a much more interesting interaction created within the sounds due to its precision being far beyond the Nord Modular, the lack of this precision in the Nord Modular creates for some interesting overlapping of envelopes, pops, clicks etc forming some very desirable results. 

I am quite pleased with the balance of sound in todays upload. I worked for some time on exploring the scope of the patch, modifying it, trying out different frequencies etc before settling on what was certainly the calmer of all the sounds made within its framework. Incidentally, I have decided to not use the external mixer in some of the recent uploads, and have been recording out of the headphones socket on the Nord Modular itself. The last three uploads all being done this way. I can't quite say exactly what I like about this method, probably as it is slightly better quality and isn't being tainted by that horrible little mixer that I must replace, but also as there is something genuinely pleasing about having a sound/sketch being created out of one or so patches. Its feels much like my clean white desk space. Todays sound, as was the case for the previous two, being the result of one single patch and nothing else. This makes me feel very happy.

Also today, whilst listening back to the recent collection of uploads, I have noticed a clearer continuity in the quality in my sounds/sketchs. I don't mean quality in the better, worser sense, but more in the sounds general sonic qualities being similar, even though perhaps slightly different styles. This is probably something that is already and more noticeable to listeners than to myself, as the realising on ones own style, or sound is often harder to pick up.

I have to say I am pleased in the direction of the recent collection of uploads, and hope also you are still enjoying following them.
