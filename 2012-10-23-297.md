I heard some <a href="http://yourdailycartoon.blogspot.se/2012/10/rip-run-wrake-1965-2012.html?m=1" title="very sad news today.">very sad news today.</a>

"It is with incredible sadness that I have to let you know that our darling Run passed away very suddenly at 5am on Sunday morning as an end result of his cancer. He had spent a beautiful Saturday with his two children Florence and Joe, his sister Fiona and myself. We left him at 7pm doing what he loved best- drawing and animating with peg bar and paper. I was with him for his last moments. We love you Run." 
- Lisa Wrake.

Run Wrake was an early inspiration for me, showing an incredible animation, beautiful sense of using sound and music, and whose breathtaking animation was filled with wonderful repetitive circles of joy.

I was only speaking to a few friends on Friday evening about our inspirations and Run Wrake came up in conversation.

I suppose we don't truly realise the significance of something until it is gone, and Run Wrake would certainly be someone who I was more touched by than I had first thought.

For tonights upload I have decide to create something inspired from the first video I ever saw of his, called 'Jukebox'. In particular the scene in which a boy peers into the T.V set at a wonderful sight and sound, whilst a head bounces around inside.

Thank you Run for bringing such inspiration to my life. 

You will be missed.
