## Sm-ll repetition.

After what seems a while of not being able to find inspiration, as the clock turns to midnight and I find myself officially a year older, I am able to make something I am very pleased with and immediately envision as something that fits the Sm-ll series sound.

For me this find a good balance between being as simple as possible and yet as repeatable as possible. Repetition being certainly something I want to concentrate on with the releases on Sm-ll, and it is such repetition that brings me that excitement once again.

It is strange how something so simple can bring such joy, and yet when I truly try to think of other peoples works that bring such exciting repetition, it does become a small list unfortunately. Perhaps I am simply not looking, or listening hard enough, and if there is anyone out there reading this now, wondering how come I have yet to mention an artists they often think of when I am rambling such things, then please do drop me an email and share.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload as much as I enjoyed creating it.
