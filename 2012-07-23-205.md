## Remembering.

Its been very hot and sunny here in London these last few days, and its the sort of weather that reminds me slightly of were I spent much of my childhood, specifically the desire to sit on top of the hill and looked over my home town, dreaming, thinking and pondering.

Perhaps I might visit my home town again soon as it's been a while since I have been back and even longer since I have spent time up on the hill looking out to sea.

Maybe a visit back home with my approaching birthday might be an idea. Spend sometime with old friends, kick around old times and reassure myself where I am and where I am going. 

As time has passed visits back home have become strangely moving each time. With each visit I become more the visitor, a stranger that little bit more. Its a feeling of combined sadness and happiness. It is a strange contradictory feeling that I am sure any of you who have been away from home are all to aware of when making that journey back.

I can't say I ever enjoy the idea of going home, and perhaps it is due to the unsettling nature of it, but I would have to say for the most part I am glad I do. Not so much to meet people I haven't seen, although that is often nice, but more to remember, to gain that needed perspective that is so easily lost when in the thick of doing.

Perhaps I will make the visit back home for my 34th birthday. A moment away to breath the sea air, to hear natures noise again, and to be able to take that deep breath before coming back to London.

The picture was taken by my partner Lucia back in 2010. I think this might have been the last time I sat on this hill, although if not, it was certainly the last time I really appreciated it. 

I am sat further down the hill on the bench, recording the wind. 

This area is called The Downs, and is looking over Swanage bay. Its a beautiful town and sometimes I miss it.
