## Good mood, good things.
audio: 411

Of all the thinking, preparing, setting up, testing, discussion and general faffing, sometimes just getting down to it and getting things done is the best thing to do.

Putting yourself in a good mood, is sometimes what makes things just seem so much easier, but recognising what it is that puts in you in that good mood it sometimes not so easy.

I found out recently, that I hadn't actually properly listening to music like I did as a teenager, for what now seems like a long long time. Sure, I have sat and listened to things, closely, dissecting every single sound, analysing every thought and moment of audio as it hits my ears, but I haven't really relaxed and enjoyed music for a long long time.

I guess perhaps due to creating it, time, where I am in my life, these could all be reason to be somewhat detached from music. But recently finding it again, finding what it can do emotionally, has been somewhat of a smack in the face.

It took the sounds of the 80's, The Art of Noise, Depeche Mode, Yazoo, Erasure, Yellow, Kate Bush, YMO. It took the 90's, Autechre, Aphex Twin, Beuamont Hannant, HIA, The Orb, Carl Craig , Tribe Called Quest, Pharcyde, and many many more. It took a reminder, a reminder through sound, a sound that put me in a mood I had almost forgotten about.

I feel alive again, I feel me again for the first time. This is the power of music, this is the power of sound creation, and I am so thrilled to have found it when I have, and been reminded of it once again.

Go listen to some music if you haven't done so in a while, really listen. Sing along, tap your thighâ€¦enjoy.
