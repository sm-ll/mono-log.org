## Shuffle patterns.

A simple and nice rolling pattern to todays upload, having something of a shuffle to it. Again, as some previous and recent uploads, it is using a combination of pulses running through filters and envelopes, nothing fancy but I just say something I haven't done at all in the Nord Modular until these recent days.

I find this way of creating patterns sometime rewarding and sometimes not, although largely an interesting and worthy way of creating for me. There tends to be a balancing of the sounds through high resonances, and small adjustments give quite dramatic changes to the feel of the patterns.

I find it also interesting at which points I feel something is working and not, and as always I like to push this idea of what is acceptable to my ears and am curious by how some of these rhythmical uploads will sound in time.

A quick post today as my mind is not where it should be, feeling I am fighting of the possibility of coming down with something. Today has been something of a dreamy day, whereby I have been struggling to understand the edges of reality, a feeling I am sure many of you are familiar with when feeling exhaustedâ€¦but after some much needed rest I hope the following days will be better.
