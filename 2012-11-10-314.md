Firstly apologies for the delay in putting up this upload. 

Yesterday I had an unexpected late night as part of my leaving doo for work and wasn't really in a good position to create something when I finally got home.

However, although missing a day, I thought it would be a good chance to try out an idea I have been kicking around for a while.

So this upload is the first of two parts, exploring the creation of a sketch using, and not using effects and not using effects from the beginning of the creative process. This upload will be using effects form the Space Echo, and the built delay on the Inkel mixer, the other part which will be upload <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_315/" title="315">315</a>, will being using much the same patch as a starting point, but will be tweaked so to work with no effects at all, creating a dry more clinical sound.

I am not sure how this will work out, but I have wanting to do this for while and now seems a good time try it out.

Enjoy.
