More pulse sound experiments for todays upload, executed in a similar way to some unexpected results during some research I did a few years back.
Simply explained, the research explored relations and social contexts, and while looking for appropriate sounds for my research I remembered <a href="http://www.create.ucsb.edu/PulsarGenerator/" title="Pulsar Generator">Pulsar Generator</a>, a software created by Alberto de Campo and Curtis Roads and felt the particular way it produced sound was perfect for what I was looking for.

Originally when hearing about this software back around the time it was launched, I was not using a Maac platform and so couldn't even try it. Since that time I had almost forgot all about it until I heard it being used (at least I think it is) in a <a href="http://www.nonvisualobjects.com/label/NVO_018/nvo018.htm" title="Richard Chartier release on NVO.">Richard Chartier release on NVO.</a> This audible reminder, along with my scanning Curtis Roads Microsound book compared with analysis of Richard's release, and with me now owning a Macbook, everything seemed to fit perfectly to revisit Pulsar Generator.

I actually created a conceptual cdr, created entirely with this software although unfortunately never realised it as a release, although do plan on revisiting this work again in the future. It was a very challenging work, for a single speaker, and one I am very proud of.

So for todays upload, there are some similarities in the sound used in this cdr, mostly found at the very end. Todays sound is far more intense listening experience by comparison, but has the hall marks of that sound, a sound I must say I really like. 

It is challenging, demanding, and influences the ears perception of sound quite dramatically afterwards. It also has similarities again to what I undersand and used as my framework to create Techno music back in the 90'sâ€¦another amount of material never released.

It is not for everyone, but I hope you can enjoy it.
