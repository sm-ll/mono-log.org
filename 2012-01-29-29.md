## Pop song.
audio: 29

Intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge and perhaps another chorus is what is squashed into a classic pop song of approximately three minutes and thirty seconds. This is also the rough length of todays upload, having very little to do with this classic pop song format, although it does share classic FM synthesis, a sound creation method that styled many a pop song in the 80's as a result of an overload of Yamaha DX7's and alike, finding may studios and stages, plugged in or otherwise as in the case of UK's Top of the Pops apparent miming period.

It is when I think of such things, that I wonder how far my taste can travel and what I can except as an interesting sound or alternatively one that is proposed as the main component for a finished track.

When considering todays sound and more specifically the way it came about, I wonder what stops me from creating more work that challenges my own taste? 

There is a tendency I feel, to aim in the obtaining of a pleasing sound to our ears, one that fits what we have built up over time as something we consider 'us'. This ‘us’, is perhaps best found in a balance, a defining of a place situated between inspiration, homage, and individualism. The paradox obviously being here, is who and how we are as an individual is largely made up of what we find inspiring and how we are paying homage to it, a delivery of respect and recognition into the perceiving world, of what we are and where we belong.

Do I prefer abstract sounds to a good pop song? possibly not, when looking for suitable images of DX7’s, I find an alternative 80’s image of Kate Bush sat with a Fairlight CMI, and immediately know this is the one. I then move to listen to<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESle1KKP6qg" title=" ‘Running Up That Hill’, along with images of Miami Vice"> ‘Running Up That Hill’, along with images of Miami Vice</a>, and immediately feel touched in ways that abstract sounds seem to struggle. It’s not better, it’s just the way it is. 

It is no surprise to me that of all the uploads I have shared, those with a more melodic tendency are also those that have received positive feedback. So as a result of this, do I upload a pop song? no I don’t…hehe, as I sit here listening to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESle1KKP6qg" title="‘Running Up That Hill’">‘Running Up That Hill’</a> again for the third time, a smile breaks over my face as I hear the pitched down and abstract voice of Kate Bush, a clear result of the Fairlight CMI and its influence on music, delivering a fresh and new sound used in part to form some incredible music from the likes of such artists as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sFK0-lcjGU" title="Art of Noise">Art of Noise</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLb9jPuDS9Y" title="Yellow">Yellow</a>, both using abstract voice samples, recordings of real life sounds and situations delivered all in a pop music structure. 

There is the saying that goes 'safety in numbers'. With this in mind, I am hoping like the structures evident in pop music and 'its' delivery, that here through my daily upload, a different structure can develop that aids my creative process. As I must say, creating something everyday for an upload, is not easy at all, not that I thought it ever would be.
