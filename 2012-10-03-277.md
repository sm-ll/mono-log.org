## Dub chord swell.

Some glitchy and raw rhythmic sound for tonights upload.

Its rare I do typical 4x4 rhythms with a kick drum these days, but I felt like it tonight. I tried to use the fade in and out of the chord to slightly change the perception of the sounds as the chord occupies similar frequencies.

For a short and simple groove it has a lot of legs I think, and has yet to bore me with its repetition, a nice balance, I hope you agree.

Enjoy.
