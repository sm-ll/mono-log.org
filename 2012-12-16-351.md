Tonights upload is dedicated to <a href="http://www.knobsounds.com/" title="Yves De Mey">Yves De Mey</a>, someone who has followed me and this blog pretty much since the very beginning, and has been incredibly friendly and supportive.

Rather coincidentally, just prior to starting on tonights upload me and my partner Lucia had been listening to Yves incredible solo work, and shared what has come to be quite a rare quiet evening together just listening. Too often recently things will get in the way of listening together. The music might well be on, but only while something else is happening, or an even worse situation we want to listen to something only to have it spoiled by typical noisy London activity.

The coincidence occurred in that while we shared time together in some rare quiet listening to Yves music, it was shortly after we found out that it was his birthday today.

This moment of listening is perhaps as close as can be for now at least, at connecting people from different parts of the world, sharing some time together with some incredible music, and perhaps a whisky or two.

Happy Birthday Yves De Mey, thanks for your friendship, support, and I hope you enjoy the upload.
