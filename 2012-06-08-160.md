160 uploads into the year, and somedays it is still hard to find a balance of pleasing sound, sketch, track ideas and experimentation, today certainly being one of those days.

It is interesting how the frame of mind or the aims one might have in creativity at any one time, largely dictate the feeling towards the end result. Take todays upload for example. Although I have slowly developed some understanding of some techniques, and the result in itself is not particularly disappointing, I can help feel its not what I was after. Could this again be that persistant perspective of mine driving any positive into oblivion.

A friend once said to me that after a certain way through the year I will probably find doing the upload a lot easier, like the forming of a habit, things would after a while become more natural. At the time, I could see the logic in this but thinking back to this point now, I would have to say that I have learned this is not simply something that can be understood as one thing.

The habit forming is the actual act of sitting infront of the Nord Modular and making something each day, uploading it and putting out into the public. If I think back this is really only part of what this blog was about, but for sure a main part. However, the question very quickly moves on or adjusts itself as the bar moves ever higher.

It is often thought that this metaphorical bar that gets set so high is one on standards, and this is partially true, but its many other things too. The bar is really not simply one thing, but a collection of bars all at different heights whose heights are perhaps understood based on certain criteria. No sooner does one things settle, such as the habit previously mentioned, along comes another thing that previously wasn't so much an issued being overshadowed by the previous.

So with today being upload 160, is it any easier? well I would have to say no its not, and in actual fact I would have to say its getting a damn sight harderâ€¦haha, but still fun. I think, no, I know, hard is fun in my book. A friend remarked today how I must be an incredibly disciplined person to do this blog each day and I immediately remembered learning somewhere that those who seem disciplined are often those who find discipline such a struggle. I would have to say I am certainly one of those people, although thinking about that now, is it something people do naturally?

It is difficult times like these, which is exactly what they are, just difficult slots of time that will pass, that I remember something I read somewhere, it could have even been today, that 'reflection is just another form of progression'.

It is often that what we need to progress has been out balanced by what we think pushes us forward, that pushing forward only exists in the literal sense of creating something, its not. I realise that I haven't reflected on what I have created in the ways that I had at the beginning and this is one sure way to understand progress, placement and intention.

When I think back to the previous uploads I can remember the first lot, the first month, and a small selection of the second month, but from that point on I really struggle to remember. Its not like I just can't remember anything, obviously I can, but more the connection to the first uploads are stronger, more embedded.

I think over the weekend, along with the ever growing list of other things need doing, I will take some time to listen back to what I have done while sitting in my listening chair, away from my equipment. I am quite keen to hear how this influences Monday's upload.

Until then, I hope you enjoy today's upload, a swingy kind of pattern made from pulse, filter and pan modules primarily.
