I remember one time in my life, where I finally felt settled and with no more the urge to run away from my home town. It was at this point I met someone who is now a very close friend who I respect a great deal. It was this person who really stood as a breath of fresh air in my little small town, an example of another way to live, another way to dream and the reason I moved finally moved away from my small little world by the sea, to never return.

Since that day I have met many amazing people, have done things I only dreamt about, have met an amazing girl who fits my unrealistic dream perfectlyâ€¦and the dream seems set to continue as long as I believe in it.

I have always a silly belief that life somehow gives us hints as to what to do, and also on occasion the subtle hint of a reward, something to say well done.

I experienced many of these moments with this friend, coincidences that led me to take notice, to know that the time had come and nothing would stop me getting my life in a better place.

I am confident that there have been many of these moments before and that many moments are yet to come. The question is not so much of if there are these moments, but more are we prepared to notice them.
