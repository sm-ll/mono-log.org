## Distractions.

A different upload for tonight and this is probably for two reasons.

The first is I wanted to try something inspired by the <a href="http://www.vladislavdelay.com/site/?page_id=5156" title="Vladislav Delay">Vladislav Delay</a> album on Raster Noton, entitled KUOPIOâ€¦and then I basically got a little lost while the patch insisted on giving me a horrible click.

The second reason is I began with a patch that was already stored in my machine called COPper. I am not sure if this is in all the machines or just mine, but over the last few days while checking and locating the buzz in my studio, I have been using and tweaking this patch to my own liking, and ended up doing this again, again getting side tracked with buzzing.

What has ended up then, is a sort of combination of an attempt at an idea that missed the target and a result of my lack of concentration today :)

Still, it didn't end up all that bad after I managed to record off an ok version for the ninth time and I have learnt a few things along the way, which is what it is all about.
