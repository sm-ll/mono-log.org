## A new year, a new project.

Back in 2008 I became aware of <a href="http://12k.com/onesoundeachday/" title="Taylor Deupree of 12k">Taylor Deupree (12k)</a> taking a polaroid image everyday, following that in 2009, Taylor continued this daily ritual with a slight change, this time he uploaded a short piece of audio collected through a microphone. 

Shortly after this I was to learn of <a href="http://unrecnow.com/dust/" title="Marcus Fischer">Marcus Fischer</a>following a similar idea but in his case he chose to be less specific and simply do something creative each day for a year. Again, more recently I was to learn <a href="http://isnajdui.bandcamp.com/" title="Katie English of Isnaj Dui">Katie English of Isnaj Dui</a> was also doing something similar, in her case it was the creation of a whole piece of music every month for a year.

All of these artists have inspired me during my own daily upload throughout the larger portion of 2011, in my case however I chose to upload a track already written each day from my archives, this work ranged from the late 90's until 2005 whereby we have reached the change of 2011 slipping into yet another year. It is time to perhaps consider how whether or not to continue with this and although I have greatly enjoyed working through my archive, after some long consideration I have come to the decision to try something new. From January 1st 2012 for one year I am instead going to create something <i>new</i> each and everyday for one year using only my Nord Modular Synth.

For many years I have been wanting to use my Nord Modular a great deal more than I have been, and loving its sound so much it seems like a great time now to not only enjoy and share its sound with others, but also take this chance to improve how I organise my day to ensure I have the time to do so. I hope you can drop by this site when you can to enjoy my uploads, I am really excited by the days to come. Please be patient while I ensure this website is fully functioning, apologies for any bugs that you might experience.

For the first sound upload, I wanted to pick something that was created last year one evening, as I feel this is a fitting beginning to bring us from 2011 to 2012. This was created shortly after listening to Taylor Deurpree's release <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/shoals/" title="Shoals, released on 12k back in 2010">Shoals, released on 12k back in 2010</a>. I am really pleased with this, but have yet to use it for anything, and figure why not start with it here. I hope you enjoy it, and stay for more.

I want to thank my partner who suggested me to use the Nord Modular each day in the first place, it was a great suggestion.
