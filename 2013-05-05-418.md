Yes, sounds created on equipment that doesn't allow endless editing. Remove the persistent want to fiddle, the relentless tweaking and changing, for it often results in a washed out, overly smushed sound that tires the ears.

Lets get less precious, rougher on those edges, create things that are only perfect through there imperfections.

The want to be impressed with sound is not the point, finding ways to be impressed in the unimpressive is perhaps more interesting. It's not in the 'next big thing' but perhaps in revisiting, seeking out the missed, finding new in the old, finding more in less, and taking joy in losing the battle for perfection.

Stop being so anal about your sounds.
