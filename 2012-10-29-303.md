So you probably thought the same as me when seeing the Snd 303 was today, that a TB303 squelching was likely. Well, I tried, and quickly found myself falling deep into texture, fuzz and dub, and I have to say probably for the better really, I mean who needs to hear another TB 303 anywayâ€¦well, maybe sometimes. :)

So tonights upload is one patch, a modified older TB303 emulation patch I made for some previous upload. As you might be able to notice it is quite modified. First I thought to add some extra Osc modules to add some sort of chord, and quickly it moved into something I haven't created before.

I also wanted to use the delays more in this upload. It is a struggle to find the time to really be able to use them and so again I have essentially jammed with the Nord Modular patch, and left a section dry with only Nord near the end, where I make some EQ tweaks.

I have to say, that this evening after a nice Single Malt things aren't sounding to bad. I recommend picking out your favourite or nearest tasty whiskey and seeing how it sounds to you. :)

I hope you enjoy it, and thanks again for all the support, messages and emails. It really is great.
