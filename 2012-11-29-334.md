Subtle bleeps and bass tone based rhythms for tonights upload.

It is a nice feeling after what has been 333 uploads, the Nord Modular is still able to provide surprises and with still more to learn.

One thing I have been really enjoying recently, especially after looking at some older patches, is finding ways to keep things smaller so using less cpu. Finding ways to put a little click here or there creating a subtle groove, or fm synthesis for hats that doesn't take up a whole patch on its own. It is these little things that both help use the Nord Modular in general, but also provide a focus on the sound that is created and what modules create that sound the best. 

Very enjoyable I have to say.

While looking back at some older patches, I am also beginning to think of future. With only 32 uploads to go I think again about what things will be like afterwards, after the year is finished and this blog will end, and if I should continue some upload, or creative process each day as I do now. I think part of the benefit is sharing these sketches with others and having it there online, available to hear by anyone at anytime, even me. Is just creating a sketch everyday for myself as I had planned, really going to be enough? or should I carry on sharing them somehow?

I guess if people are still enjoying them, I could carry on? Use different equipment even? 

What do you think?
