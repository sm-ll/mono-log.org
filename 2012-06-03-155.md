The results of division have always interested me. The very notion of having something then working in direct relation with that something through division, allows for a kind of complex simplicity, a sonic or visual cog mechanism, with everything working at ease through an interconnected relationship with everything else.

I think for the first time I think I can begin to appreciate the fascination shared by enthusiastic clock makers.

For me there is always a joy in the relationship of one to another. Sounds that fill a space yet seem lost within it, want to be something yet aren't, fit a context yet be outside of it, overly simplistic yet ever revealing more complexity. To me these ideas that cannot live alone, that are always in connection with something else, are what makes things a joy.

Many of my uploads, and todays being no exception, comes via a division of multiple parameters, be it ones connected to spatial or time positioning, frequency or amplitude, many share this interconnected relationship.

I am very pleased with todays upload, and I think for tomorrows, and thinking ahead is always a good sign for me, I will try to do something using only basic division of clicks and see how we end up.

Todays image also comes through a division process, as many have been already, and again I am pleased with this one. I feel I am slowly moving through a doorway to something I have always appreciated but perhaps was only stood on the threshold, unable to see beyond, and so unable to step forward.

I hope you enjoy todays upload.
