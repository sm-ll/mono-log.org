Today I finally manages to succeed in creating movement through control from the logic modules. This is something I have attempted on and off, and always never quiet got it to deliver what I was looking for.

Much like yesterdays upload, I wanted to create a shifting of patterns, that move perception in and out of rhythm structures, adjusting the position in pattern and hopefully drawing attention to different aspects of the sounds more than might be possible with completely independent textures or patterns. I also wanted to create a contrasting of pace, so the neither a sense of fast or slow pace can fully be experienced.

The purpose or goal in wanting to do this, is hopefully to be able to understand a little more my music, and position my perspective of it between being one that fits a more still and focused listening environment, and a different focused environment being one of a more club context perhaps.

I suppose some general responses could be that few would dance to this, or this wouldn't work in a club. I feel even within minimalist Richard Chartier's work, if turned up, this would work perfectly along side some early work by the likes of Richie Hawtin. The biggest barrier here perhaps, is one of our own perspective, and it is this perspective that I believe needs to be constantly challenged.

The electronic music I grew up listening to, was forward thinking, experimental, exploratory within its genre, and for me one that was defined by its interpretation and challenge of a structure, a system, wether that be musically or socially.

I want to continue with this, and attempt to try and find and understand that balance point, the point of perspective shift, and sit what I create at this point, in a kind of metaphorical moment of understanding, adjustment, interpretation, definition. I hope that if that point is a small area, personal perspective will split, fall either side, with no clear right or wrong, no clear context, with its context torn slightly.
