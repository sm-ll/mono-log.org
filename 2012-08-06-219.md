Most of this evening was spent working on a new and improved TB303 emulation, a smaller patch ultimately improving the sequencing to function a bit better.

If anyone has experimented towards a specific goal, you will be well aware of the temptation to peel away from the experiment to explore something that comes out of this experimenting, leaving behind what initially was the task at hand. This happened for me quite a bit today, being surprised by some interesting sounds again and again coming from incorrect patching in the Nord Modular. It wasn't too long until I had to save one of these sounds to a separate file, to go back to, and this is what began as tonight upload.

Another sketch in creating a groove with the minimum of sounds, yet all the time trying to keep something close to the dub-techno sound.

Through not having the delay effects available in the Nord Modular, it insists I work without, and leaving plenty of space for delays to work, I often image how things could sound at points twanging into delay. As I have mentioned before, I am not a big fan of using effects if not needed, specifically in the writing stage, and really only like to bring them in when they can bring something to what is already enjoyable enough without, a sort of option more than anything. 

The good thing about the Nord's lack of effects is I am growing ever fonder of sounds that work well without, finding ways to make sure they work without, and both my attempts are getting better and my ears are adjusting to hearing things dry. Having said that I am very much looking forward to using effects at an eventual stage, in a way that hopefully more adjusts sound or alters its position more than adding anything to a track.

Reverb is another effect that is generally find difficult to use, and remember enjoying its use the most when the dry signal is completely gone, leaving only the reverb. Again this feels to me more a swapping of sound than one sound being added to another. I remember when creating Techno years ago, always enjoying fading between wet and dry signals, specifically when the feel of where the pattern is gets shifted, lost if effects.

There has been lots of have been thinking about this evening, but most certainly the main thing that stick in my mind is getting some more of these uploads into finished tracks. It is pretty much the thing that is at the forefront of my mind each day, and so I should really get cracking as soon as I can, and perhaps I can share some excerpts on Soundcloud.

Until then I hope you enjoy tonights upload.
