## Doing.

Recently I have been reminded of the importance in working harder than you might think your able. I used to believe that some people are just more energetic than others, and this is likely the reason they are able to work longer, harder than most. The truth is, we all feel exhausted, we all struggle with being bothered, finding the point and the energy to do. The real difference comes is that despite feeling tired, some of us just do it anyway. 

On the way home from work today while attempting to finish my book, I was drawn to the conversation opposite me. A young girl was explaining to her friend of how she felt her "brain was simply wired differently", and this bad wiring prevented her from doing so much. She believed that because of this should could never be good at her job, could never learn a second language or ever be able to do many of the things she wished she could. As she repeated many times, her brain simply wasn't "wired that way".

As I sit here exhausted, internally debating my enthusiasm for everything and anything, knowing that others are still working hard on projects in this late hour, or waking after only short amounts of sleep and long amounts of travel, they are still pushing, still working, still supporting, and trying to enjoy the process for its good and bad. They enjoy, as the alternative is not doing anything at all, not helping, not supporting, not directing their life. Not doing is boring and life consuming, it sucks out any enthusiasm and point for doing anything ever. This fear of not doing is actually the same fear that stops us from doing. We scare ourselves into doing nothing. 

Thinking of these people, the people that push through and do anyway, makes me dig deeper in achieving and enjoying more, more learning, more failure, and more doing.

I want to do more, I want everyone to do more. The more we all do, the better things will be, the better those around you will be. The doing and sharing and excitement that comes with the good and bad. Its both a mental and physical workout that pays off in the knowing that we can do things. Knowing that whatever happens it is a journey that is worth every second, but it is only a journey if we choose to take it.

If you have the feeling to do something, just get rid of that feeling as soon as you start to feel it, and just start that thing you are tempted to start, do whatever it is and do it now.
