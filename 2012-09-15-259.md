## Late night variations in Nord.

Today I created some edits with my Roland TR606 and Lucia's MFB Kraftzwerg that I uploaded to my <a href="http://soundcloud.com/moize/sets/studio-pokk/" title="Soundcloud" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> page, and so for tonights upload I thought I would take some inspiration or direction from these edits, in creating something for the Nord Modular.

Both similar sounds and patching that was used in the MFB Kraftzwerg in earlier today, I have also used in the Nord Modular tonight. This switching between equipment is something I have missed for many years while working in the computer, and it is this method of switching or borrowing direction from one machine to another, reminds me of an interview with UK based Warp artists Autechre, whom explained finding much inspiration in the Nord Rack synths, and as a result often would try to emulate a type of sound or work method found with the Nord Rack but in other pieces of their studio gear, that they otherwise might have thought to be limited.

I can certainly relate to this, and I am sure many of you can too. Each machine has its own character, and technique of working, often something that is numbed or even entirely lost when working in a computer environment. This is not to say all software is the same, as it clearly isn't, but for me having all this software essentially in one box, the computer, it all gets sort of lumped in together when considering the bonding of a relationship with it.

Perhaps all what I am saying here isn't entirely accurate, as I am sure there are many counter arguments to this, and there should be, but still for some reason this is how I feel today. Perhaps I have yet to put my finger on entirely what it is that finds inspiration in different places to computer based work. Regardless, both have their merits and I use them and enjoy them both fully for what they are.

I have been thinking to create some textured based stuff like previously, but at present this is just the mood I am in. I hope you are enjoying the journey with me.
