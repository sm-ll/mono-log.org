Today I read an interview with <a href="http://de-bug.de/musik/10677.html" target="_blank">Boards Of Canada</a>, this is the second I have read since the release of their latest album Tomorrows Harvest. It is a typically cryptic interview, although that could be just the media's words I have heard again and again drilling into my own, but in the sense that the interview doesn't reveal much in general, it does however touch upon albeit briefly, a few things that are quite interesting to me, namely technology, how we use it, get used to it, and the future of such development in our lives.

I think from my perspective, technology is not something that is so simple as the latest gadgets, but more a case of when an object separate from us, but used or relied on by us, is in some ways influencing our own life. It is undoubtably the internet that has been the biggest influencing technology that has affected us all in some way and it is this that Boards of Canada mention.

Within the interview was the mention of a kids having everything they want at a push of a button and that much work went into the  creation of expectation of something through the use of their various pre-sales promotion techniques of sneaky random 12's and billboard adverts.

Expectation is something that has been on my hot list for some time and has been amongst many thoughts that fall close to nostalgia which I find rather fitting considering Boards of Canada's clear affection to a dreamy impression of the past. One thing that always concerns me when speaking of the past and the present, is the rather powerful affect nostalgia has on us. I find such talk of "kids today" or "killing the magic" classic phrases that often surround an idea of what was, and what is no longer, in an odd desire to keep still, or perhaps more go back to before the present stillness, to a particular time, an imagined heyday perhaps, that seems significant for whatever reason.

My worry is, that although it is true, those who have been around longer do have the advantage of having seen before and now, are in danger of having a biased view of what is best for next. Of course I am not suggesting Board of Canada think this at all, but they does help to kick off some thoughts around the subject of where do we aim for next, and should be aim ahead or forever look back, pining and emulating what has been, never quite succeeding in creating the same moments again.

A recent article I read about the increase of record pressing plants, had a nice phrase that reminded me of our often skewed view when dealing with nostalgia, "kids today" or more importantly kids of any day. When asking kids why they don't listen to CD's they answered "my dad listens to cd's, why would I do that?".

Is it still true that things are forever moving in cycles? Trends come and go and return just as quick?

I wonder if while we wait for somethings to come back, or think of those things before as better, we might start to think of what is todays version of that thing before. If there evident in something today, that thing of the past? I don't that in this thinking, it even need be the same area, but perhaps possess's many of the same qualities.

My preferred way is of a looking back to be able to look ahead.

I have enjoyed what interviews I have read of Boards of Canada, and although have not heard the full album yet, what I have heard I have been pretty disappointed with. Largely perhaps due to my excitement around reading they had ventured down a different road, something a little edgier than before. To my ears so far this is not the case. To be fair it seems more a case of those aspects of Boards of Canada that I listened to and enjoyed before, is just simply not the direction they have taken it. Or perhaps much like Warp Records themselves, what was once a label that seemed more about introducing new music, at least to my ears, has slowly shifted into its own parody, with more artists that sound like their heyday. A great label to be sure, and one I continue to watch and listen to, if only from a far far distance.

Jaded.

(Todays upload is a little play and result of my finding another interesting floor in my TR-606 that is perhaps one unique to only my machine. My Cymbal turns into a slightly unstable shorted hat sound when in 'Write' mode, as apposed to 'Play' mode. Although not caught in this recording, but certainly why I pressed record, the pitch dropped considerably, tuning itself like a TR-808â€¦evidently the tuning stopped as soon as recording begun. Pretty generic, but full of metal hats which I love. Enjoy)
