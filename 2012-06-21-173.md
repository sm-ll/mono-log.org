## Radical shifts.
audio: 173

Some more sound creation that probably falls under Pokk!. 

A rapid, shifting of beats, bass, and splutters that I am kinda liking in this late hour after my small bottle of beer.

Again, for those Nord Modular tech heads, this is created in one Nord patch, and runs through my little crappy mixer for a little balance on the EQ. Again it makes heavy use of those logic modules in generating the patterns and soundsâ€¦oh boy how I love them. 

I hope you enjoy tonights upload.
