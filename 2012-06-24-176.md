## Under all the static.

Perhaps when amidst the many challenges we all face in our life whatever they maybe, the pressure of work, the choices we have to make, our belief in ourselves or our ability to listen to others, there comes a point under all that static we can begin to realise that perhaps we have been here before, that its just that same old Pied Piper paying that tune we have been lead by so many times before. That we need to stop, think for ourselves and listen to what we believe, and walk another way. 

And know that even if that route turns out wrong, that it is a wrong that we can learn from through our experience of it, and use that to make better decisions in our life, the life that we lead and what others to share with us. 

It is better this, than lying there looking up at a ceiling and thinking of the 'what ifs' in our life. And all the while we think, we are following that Pied Piper to a destination we know we have no interest in going to, but are just all to afraid to step out of line.
