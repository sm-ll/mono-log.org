## FellMark Synthesis

I have been experimenting with FM synthesis today, something I havenâ€™t really dived into nearly as much as I would have liked over the years. I think this is mainly due, apart form not having suitable technology to do so, as I find it very hard to work with, long winded and sound can often have that 'typical' FM sound, which I generally dislike working with.Partly due to this struggle I have attempted in breaking this complex and challenging creator-tool relationship.

Another part of for this adventure into FM, is my ongoing amazement by the work of SND and Mark Fell, and so I wanted to try something in that area, although creating something in these small amount of hours today, is not nearly enough time to get as close in understanding as much as I would like to. Further to that, to create and explore in FM synthesis in the Nord Modular at this depth can be a little numbing on both the eyes and the ears, a good numbing, but a numbing all the same.

This upload is using various logic modules in the Nord for triggering FM sounds, along with a bit of tweaking here and there. I hope you enjoy it.
