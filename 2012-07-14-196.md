## Concept patterns.

Another great day and evening of talk, sharing and listening to music. Kicking around future plans, thoughts and ideas for Sm-ll to be more than a label…lots of ideas that hope to help others…exciting times and good times.

All the while supported by various Techno sounds throughout the day, most notably by Lucia creating her first experiments with Techno while everyone listened on in utter amazement at her skill. Certainly a Sm-ll artist of the future.

A little tipsy after a great day, with some nice Taiwanese tea to end another great evening. 

If you haven't met up with those friends you have been meaning to for sometime, do yourself the favour and make it happen.

I hope you enjoy the upload, a minimal, experimental sketch of shifting patterns.
