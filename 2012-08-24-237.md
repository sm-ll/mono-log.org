## More reflection.

I have spent most of today while at work listening back to previous uploads, and was able to hear for the first time something I had not yet been able. Whether it is due to the time delay from creating it or the fact I listened to so many on shuffle, it was a surprising experience to hear such new aspects of the sound.

Clearly I feel todays upload has been inspired by this listening back, and as a result todays upload takes shape as a sound that perhaps rides the middle of some of those style I listened to.

Combinations of dub, chord, rhythm and texture all seem to be apparent, and I have to say it is sounding ok in the late hours.

I hope you enjoy this upload and can find what I am experiencing during your listening.
