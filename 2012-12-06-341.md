## New sound and old.

Tonights upload is trying out the new TR-606 hats and cymbals I have been working on today (in the Nord Modular), very happy I am with them too. I imagine I will still continue to tweak them over time, but they are certainly the closest I have got them so far.

The style seems kind of nostalgic in some respects, old electronic sounding, yet similar to some previous uploads also. Not sure what to make of it yet, but it surely slightly opens the door to some more melodic stuff in the futureâ€¦perhaps.

I hope you enjoy the upload.
