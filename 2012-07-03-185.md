Some more chilled dub sounds for tonights upload. I gotta say as enjoyable as it was creating this one, it was a hard one to balance the sounds.

I think I spent an hour alone just trying to get the hats to behave. I basically wanted to created some stereo spread with a short delaying of the triggers to give the hats body. It was not so bad in tuning the delay for the hats, but adjusting multiple filters and envelopes was a tricky fish to keep ahold of.

Still, I will definitely be doing more of that, just because it was so tricky, gotta catch that fish so I can fry itâ€¦what the hell am I on about tonight :)

Anyway, I am thinking again about building smaller patches that I can revisit, a hat patch or a kick drum patch, chords that sort of thing. Sort of versatile patches that I can reuse.

Maybe I wont reuse them so much for the daily uploads, but can build an upload out of flexible patches made that day. We will see how it goes.

Anyway, it is late and I have to wake up again in 5 hours, so I will leave my thoughts here. 

I hope you enjoy the upload and thanks again for listening and sharing.
