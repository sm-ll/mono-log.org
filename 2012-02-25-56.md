## Sound weekend.
audio: 56
---
A beautiful day in London to encourage a weekend of sound creating as me and Lucia make our final preparations <a href="http://www.oboro.net/archive/exhib1112/05_sublimation/info_en.html" title="for our performance in Canada.">for our performance in Canada.</a>

Time is of the essence and so todays upload draws off previous work ideas and techniques to speed things along a bit. The simple use of tones, hiss and crackle are used, fitting into a familiar language of sound and sound creating made by myself back in 2000-2003. As a result of this familiarity I am immediately happy with it, easily fitting into what I understand and have experienced aplenty, and yet am also slightly surprised, as is often the case with these things, at the subtle development and variation since this time, again perhaps owed to the beautiful sound that comes from this Nord Modular. 

I really just can't get enough of this Nord and its flexibility, which is obviously a good thing considering we are only on day 56 with another 310 uploads to goâ€¦
