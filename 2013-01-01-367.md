Firstly, just a quick message to say Mono-log will be trying out a slightly new format and so expect some changes in the near future. 
Are these changes are for the better or not? only time and you will tell, and please do so. I will be adding commenting to this blog shortly, along with other bits, but please bare with me as it makes the transition. 

Until then please feel free to let me know your thoughts about the changes by leaving a comment on my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/martin.thompson.904" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>, please be gentle with me :) 

Ok, lets get 2013 started.

### DESIRE #

We can all relate to wanting something in our music studios that would 'make things sound better'. We can perhaps remember justifying to ourelves, or a bemused partner for that matter, that owning some vital piece of equipment or software would 'change everything'. 

'It's what (enter name of favourite artist here) uses, I need it.

But perhaps sometimes we should honestly ask ourselves, why do we want it? and ultimately, do we really need it at all?

Such iconic machines such as the Roland TR-808, TR-909, TB-303 for an obvious example, have embedded into them not only the sounds of their impressive circuitry, but also a representation of a whole movment in music, culture and patrially formed the way we thnk and understand electronic music. Such iconic machines have within them iconic stories, some from failure to incredible and unexpected heights and sound into the ears of the many who their sounds fell upon.

It is no wonder that such machines are considered key ingredients  to many genres and artists creative process, and rightly so.

Could we have had acid without the Roland TB-303? 
What would Jeff Mills sound like without the Roland TR-909? 
What would have Techno been without the creation of such machines?

### POSSESSION #

If lucky enough to own such an iconic machine, it does pose the question of how to use its sound, shall it also be iconically?

Does the iconic machine insist to be used in iconic ways? 

The temptation of tweaking that frequency dial on the TB-303 for example is far to great to resist for many, and yet rarely do we hear the TR-909 Bass Drum being tweaked in such the same way.

From the desire, through to the actual owning of the iconic machine, comes the next stage of how it is actually used to create. 

So how does the iconic machine influence us as we create in our studios?
Does owning the TB-303 mean having to make Acid-esque tracks? 
Are we to give in to its history and begin creating more classic sounding Techno rhythms now that we own that TR-909?

### MAKING SOUNDS #

As we sit in our studios with the iconic machines of our choice surrounding us, are we constantly challenged by them to make the sounds that came with them? The classic squelching sounds of the TB-303, the thudding blocks of rhtymical TR-909 or dynamiclly funky TR-808, all delivering a genre with each sound, all secretly working together locking away any creative innovation we might have. 

The tools that helped form whole new genres, movements in culture, brought about changes in law, are these tools also unable to deliver anything more than references to a time past, a genre nicely formed but perhaps paused and now waiting for something to move it forward once again?

It is a slightly worry and equal wonder that through the passing of time and the development of technology, those very genres holding experimentation, inovation, forward thinking very much in its DNA, have become more a replicating of 'that' sound, than one of creating its 'new' sound?

The ever uttered questions of the past 'where is it all going?' or 'will it ever die?' that seemed to be on the lips of many attached to the beginning of what has undoubtably become an incredible time in electronic music, have seemed long since silenced. 

When was the last time we asked such questions? 
When did we think again about its future as a growing community as we seemed to once do before? 
Has the socially networked world today been too busy shouting 'look at me look at me', to have forgot the more vital question we can now all ask togetherâ€¦

Where are we all looking towards?
