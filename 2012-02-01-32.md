Me and Lucia are working towards our performance at <a href="http://www.oboro.net/archive/1112.html" title="Oboro in Canada">Oboro in Canada</a> on March 3rd as <a href="http://www.mimosamoize.com/" title="mimosa|moize">mimosa|moize</a>, and so I felt using my daily uploads here, would be a good chance to share some of the sounds that may or may not be used in the performance, as we work in the build up to that day.

Through many of our performances together, it is the restrictions that have proven to enable us to find a sound we are surprised by, or a direction that we have generally been pleased with. Due to our busy schedules this year of activities outside of <a href="http://www.mimosamoize.com/" title="mimosa|moize">mimosa|moize</a>, we have decided on a working relationship that generates sounds in a way that best fits with our other commitments and schedules. 

I will be passing over to Lucia the sounds I have created and shared here each day, for her to further process. Unlike my chosen approach, being one of building the sounds from scratch into a realm and testing of perception, Lucia is going to find volume and mass in these sounds, but explore them in a minimal fashion. To clarify this slightly, where as my sounds will be complex but only subtly perceivable, Lucia's will be far more perceivable, yet alternatively relatively simplified. 

We hope with this difficulty in how we create, perceive and work with sound, that a result outside of what we initially can comprehend now, might be achieved. Ultimately we would like the sounds to be the guide for us, not us guiding the sounds, and by developing a system of working, keeping the sounds simple, we hope this can be achieved.

This sound is reasonably quite and as a result I felt encouraged to use the hiss and poor quality of the mixer to bring something subtle but a generally beneficial element to the overall sound.
