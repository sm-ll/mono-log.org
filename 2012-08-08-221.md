## Routine.

Some fun with tones and textures for tonights upload, an old favourite sound of mine. 

Not much to write home about but something I always enjoy on those days when feeling relaxed…hmm, or would that be better said, 'nothing to email home about?' perhaps not even that, maybe we don't write or email home anymore, but just share what we do, when we do it…I mean my mum hasn't even got the internet. I recently had to explain what the internet is and how it works. How the world changes beneath without us realising it.

I recently received some news clippings from my Mum in an envelope, and even more recently some photos of me as a child with my birthday card. It was an amazing feeling to receive these and knowing it would have been a great feeling for her to dig them out, and send them off. 

The searching through old times, the routine of her day, the trip to the postbox, who did she meet along the way? 

I said at the time I would send something back, but of course I have yet to do this. I will though. Years ago this was exactly how it was. Time would pass, we would forget, and then through the letterbox comes a reply…amazing. I think I have only ever received a handful of letters in my life.

I think it is amazing how we easily forget older ways, and easily accept them being replaced with their modern version, as often they seem more efficient, and this make sense generally speaking. But writing letters was never about being quick, and so really the email as not replaced it at all, the email doesn't really do anything the letter did. All that has happened is we have narrowed the ways we express ourselves, and yet we have so many more ways to do it.

I think tonight instead of working, I am going to write a letter to someone, something I think I only did once or twice in my life and they were probably as a kid to get something free, or a list to Santa, or to be on some kids TV show. And obviously Santa would never write back…'to busy' I was told, I would rarely get that free gift…'nothings for free' I was told, or I would only get to watch some <i>other</i> kid do a really bad job at the show I was on.

The old ways, the old sayings, the old that we so easily dismiss and attempt to separate ourselves from. We will all be old, and will all get confused and be found as loveable old farts to the youngsters, jaded by life.

A letter to my mum…yes that is what I will do, and you should write one too…she'd like that :)
