## Our world and acting responsibly in it.

I had a really interesting response to my post yesterday from <a href="http://www.knobsounds.com/" title="Yves De Mey">Yves De Mey</a>, (electronic music creator and one half of Sendai), that got me thinking a little more. Yves view was that the reality of the situation of labels unable to pay there artists, is mainly through them not being paid themselves. Essentially nobody is buying the music. I have to say this totally makes sense, and I totally agree with this. This got me thinking as to what exactly is causing sales to be so low? 

Although I agree with Yves, and perhaps this is more my personality, I want to place the blame at 'our' feet, for the listeners and us are actually one and the same people.

I remember Autechre talking about a similar situation many years ago. Their thoughts were that although sales of music in total have gone up, there is generally more proliferation. The idea being that the sales are being spread over many artists and labels instead of a key few. More music sold, the wealth of those sales is spread out.

So is it that listeners, you and me, are simply not buying music anymore? Are we buying less because there is so much more to buy? 
Or are our tastes and purchases being stretched far and wide?

It is quite likely that if our purchase 'are' being spread over many places, that we are also less able to truly invest ourselves into anyone label or artists as much as what may have happened previously. So with less invested into a label or artist, we might be less likely to also buy from that label or artist. We simply move around, and we move around quickly.

Admittedly this is all theory, but I certainly remember when growing up feeling a huge connection to certain labels and buying almost all my music from these select few. For me, I remember thinking of myself and positioning me as an individual who was a Rising High Records guy, or Warp Records guy. Some key artist in the Techno world, would have been Plastikman, Carl Craig, Joey Beltram to name a few. Eventually this world changed with the arrival of the label Mille Plateaux, and this was who I was, who I could relate to. The label was part of me, part of what I stood for. As some labels changed and I changed, I shifted until I found what best suited me as a person and my tastes.

I can imagine many of you who were around near the beginning, a beginning for us at least, can remember similar memories, a similar past of how you decided on those purchases. Does this still happen as much now I wonder?

So if this is only to be a memory, what has changed since that time? Are we now faced with so much music that our voices are harder to hear? Or could it be something else?

For me, the blame is again on us, it lies at our feet, and how we use the internet.

With the internet, not only can I research multiple labels, artists and some random connections I wasn't even searching for, I can also hear excerpts or often full tracks of music through Soundcloud, Youtube, Bandcamp etc

Through such listening services a general listener can decide quickly if they want to buy something or not. The very nature of the internet insists that we move fast. The internet and its usages is generally not a place for pondering. It is a fast paced navigating frenzy of clicking, searching, starting and stopping and half engaging with media.

So is the problem not so much people aren't buying music anymore, but in actual fact many of us are not even listening?

Yesterday I saw a comment on Facebook that makes me think that others are also thinking along similar lines. Will Thomas Long, member of Celer and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Oh-Yoko/154030671364127?sk=wall&filter=12" title="Oh, Yoko">Oh, Yoko</a> posted:

"If you want to support independent artists and record labels, please buy their releases, not just 'like' it. Please share this if you agree."

The irony being this got many 'likes' but also did get many shares. What stood out here was again a question of how we engage in those we support. The 'like' button. 

This button is again an example of a fast paced interaction that although does show support, doesn't put food on the table, (as my Dad would often say).

So I wonder if the situation is more about changing our habits, and educating ourselves, the listeners, into engaging in those we support in ways that may have been more present before the internet overwhelmed us with the many, many choices we face today.

I think I am drawn here to the old saying 'lead by example'.

I believe we are still working on ways to successfully use the internet and its resources to promote and engage in the things that we like. I feel already a noticeable change has occurred in what was initially a manic absorption of all information, into more people showing a dedication and interest in the niche. I strongly believe that the tide is beginning to sway the other way, our habits on the internet and how we find ourselves, represent ourselves, is returning to share similarities to what once came before, and we need to be ready for it. We need to be ahead of the game and fully invested into recognising ways to engage our listeners, to allow them to invest into our world, and to feel they can share this world with us for longer than a quick clicking of 'like'.

This brings me back to the example of the non-profit label and how it works.

If the label is unable to do more for its artists, or what it is doing is less affective, then the artist may feel they are not getting a support that really matches their aims or their idea of a label and its role. As a result, I think its fair to say many artists have decided on starting their own label. However, I have to wonder as artists running our own labels, of which I am one of them again very soon, we need to be careful of how and why we are doing this.

If we imagine for a moment that the artist is not represented well by the label and chooses to go it alone, unless that artist has a strong desire to put right the very things it wasn't receiving from the labels they worked with, are they not adding to the problem? We need to be careful this label of ours is not simply self-indulgence if we are to support the world we are involved in. As Lucia pointed out to me, self-indulgence is reminiscent of the hobby. Sure, it maybe on the terms of the artist but are they the right terms for others or the community in general?

The worry is with more labels being run by artists with little to no money, the temptation to turn to cheaper alternatives, CDR, downloads, the net-label, non-profit etc, is all a bit to tempting. The result being that perhaps we have more and more labels run by less and less engaged people. Everyone is creating, and nobody is listening.

Ultimately I feel a label needs to be a solid, and sustainable place that represents something that listeners can choose to be involved in or not. A place that you identify with and can recognise within it, yes this is me. I am a Warp person. I am a Rising High person. The label needs to engage with money, not side step it. It needs to do more than simply sharing and linking, but working towards securing its own future. Its needs to demonstrate a dedication to the music, and a realistic and sensible approach to how money is used in this dedication. The labels needs to be the voice, listener and educator, engaging in the world it is involved in and not seeing it as a creative burden, but as an asset. We all need to understand how to use the internet, its services, and make the best decisions in when and how to use such services.

Above all we need to start working together.
