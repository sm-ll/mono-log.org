## A muted SH-101 chord?

Today I created a simple emulation of the<a href="http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/sh101.php" title=" Roland SH-101 synthesizer" target="_blank"> Roland SH-101 synthesizer</a> with the intention of maybe either creating some looping type sounds with it, running through the delay patch I made a few days back, or something in a style reminiscent of <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Robert-Hood-Minimal-Nation/release/2386" title="Robert Hood's Minimal Nation" target="_blank">Robert Hood's Minimal Nation</a>, or <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Steve-Stoll-Damn-Analog-Technology/release/2023149" title="Steve Stoll's Damn Analog Technology" target="_blank">Steve Stoll's Damn Analog Technology</a>.

However, getting close to the sound of my old SH-101, was not close enough, and I immediately found all the techniques I would have used back in the 90's wouldn't quite sit right within the Nord Modular, 'that' sound I was looking for was just not found in quite the same way. I immediately felt like I needed my old Atari STE back, some old Kenton gear to link everything up, and a working method that was built around the technology that was partly responsible for the sounds I wanted.

I can't help but wonder again how much an association or time and place with equipment influences how it is used. I look at my Nord Modular and can't hear such things like Techno coming from it, but sounds that are more tools to use perhaps in creating the samples needed. It is obviously not saying the Nord 'can't' do Techno, obviously things simply don't work that way, but I felt when using it today, I was having to find a place in the long gap between the last time to this time, where I created such styles. The working environment seemed familiar, but at the same time an impostor, an emulation.

I find too, when trying to set the parameters on the Nord Modular, as I would with the SH-101, it just felt all wrong, and the marks or places of these parameters, didn't line up with what I remembered, like reading a different interpretation of the same philosopherâ€¦it just feels all wrong.

This reminds me also of time when we might re-visit something we believe we remember well, only to be surprised and slightly confused at what we discover. A familiar yet seemingly and almost entirely forgotten part of history might sit before us, as we realise that old series, game or film was not so good as we might have thought.

So, what do we have for todays sound? Well I would have to say it is something that for me showed again the importance of how we think about our equipment, our tools, our technology, and how we think about it for its purpose, its context. 

Ultimately again I feel it is a matter of perspective, and from what I have learned recently, a matter of shifting ones perspective is all it takes to keep things exciting, or making things happen. Often the emphasis is on being stimulated by news sounds or new technology, that one replaces another or the old must make way for the new, where I am finding more it is the same things over and over that can be just as stimulating, if we can just think about ourselves and how we can change each time we interact with something.
