## Listening back with dusty ears.

I have been recently listening to my old archives, wondering once again what should I do with them, and while contemplating this I decided to rework an old track I did in Bidule for todays upload, a track I made back in 2004, around the time I first met Mike and experienced Small Fish Records and also found the work of <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Stephan-Mathieu-Full-Swing-Edits/release/155205" title="Stephan Mathieu and the album Full Swing Edits" target="_blank">Stephan Mathieu and the album Full Swing Edits</a>(still one of my all time favourite albums) , and also the album <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/every_action/" title="Every Action by the ever abstruse Motion" target="_blank">Every Action by the ever abstruse Motion</a>, both my first introduction to both artists and labels and a huge influence on me.

Todays variation of this older work, is adjusting the shifting filters to be much calmer than the original, and concentrates more on creating something that shares some similarity with tape saturation or slightly worn tape. I quite enjoy the effort the ears have in digging past the dusty unstable signal to hear the modulating tones underneath.

I am quite enjoying this one this evening, it seems fitting to how my day has been. :)
