As we approach nearly a month of uploads from the Nord Modular, I am beginning to wonder where a sound ends and a track begins? It has been a very difficult process to feel comfortable in leaving some sounds at a certain stage, uploading it, and to then know it will be listened to in some raw, early and perhaps unfinished stage?

Often during the creation of a 'sound', I concern myself with time, I have other things to do in a day and that often while working o a patch, the sounds just wont behave themselves and the magic just doesn't quite happen. Another time when experiencing it all start to come together, it might do so in an unexpected way, delivering to my ears a challenging style of soundâ€¦and as it does this a question mark appears over my head and asks what is actually my taste in sound? and what is my preference when choosing parameters when creating sound during the creative process?

Today I found myself creating a sound that seems to sit on a line of what I might consider 'my style' or 'me' and yet it also sits dangerously close to falling into a world of genres I generally don't feel myself situated. I suddenly realise how changing the context I find myself in, is a little more complex that I might have initially thought. I have my own restrictions that fall outside my intention, that are building through a residue or affect of 'doing'. 

I also suddenly realise what I initially was thought as an exciting and exploratory project with the Nord, has become an almost intimidating endeavour, as I experience yesterday as the first real day of difficulty in creating something I can feel confident and happy about.
