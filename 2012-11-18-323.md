Tonights upload uses the basic core of yesterdays patch experiment albiet slightly changed and used in a more suitable style.

Also I have worked in the Space Echo and Inkel mixer for some extra reverb and delay on occasion, and also tweaking the timing slightly of the pattern and a few other bits.

Bit of a quirky sound jammed, but I am quite liking this direction I have to say.

I hope you enjoy it.
