Another quick upload tonight, again my day seems to have slipped by. It just goes to show how much it takes to form habits sometimes, and even still creating a daily upload is not quite habit formed yet. I wonder why that is? I remember to brush my teeth each day, more than once, or make a coffee, and yet creating an upload is not as easy… perhaps it is simply that it is not as easy.

I also noticed Taylor Deupree has not started his uploads either, I believe he is working on his studio. I am quite interested if he lets it slide now the beginning of the year has passed, or if he can start having missed a few days. I always sense as humans we are dedicated to a sort of system, rounding up, starting in a new year, when really anytime we start or stop should be fine. I for one hope he does start very soon, even if it is a few tones put together on his kitchen table :)

Do it Taylor. Your tones are some of the best there are.

In-fact that is what I should have done tonight myself, instead of this weird little groove. I think I will do this in the future, a sort of get out of jail free card, if all else fails, or a bit tired… sine tones, they sound great.

A quirky sound, not great, but that is how it rolls sometimes. Lesson learned. :)
