Tonights upload is a sound I have been toying with for a while and yet never quite got it where I wanted it. I have been very pleased with many of the rhythmic uploads thus far, but really wanted to reach something that had the simplicity of perhaps one of my favourite Plastikman tracks <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Plastikman-Artifakts-BC/release/151883" title="Hypokondriak" target="_blank">Hypokondriak</a> on the Artifakts album. Obviously many of Richie Hawtins tracks are incredible, but for me, that track said a great deal about what can be just enough to hold a track together, and that is something I have always preferred in music.

It was actually the very opposite of a track being just enough, that pushed me away from much of the UK based electronic music being released on Warp Records. What was once a label delivering electronic music, that was clinical, emotional and forward thinking, became a style in its own right, and ever more complex, with more and more programming showed off within every single secondâ€¦not what I enjoyed.

Tonights sound I could have listened to for ages, but have decided to record only a short amount to upload.

I hope you enjoy it.
