A variation on upload <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_276/" title="276" target="_blank">276</a> is tonights creation I would like to share with you.

This one captures really how I feel and where I am with certain things these daysâ€¦I am not sure how that might come across, I can only hope you enjoy listening to it :)

A short post as it is very late, although one thing I will mention before I go is this. 

Just tonight <a href="http://geometrydaily.tumblr.com/" title="I found this website called Geometry Daily." target="_blank">I found this website called Geometry Daily.</a> One of the designs is used for todays picture, it reminded me a little of Taylor Deupree's album Stil.

If you thought my creating a sound each day in the Nord was a challenge, well Geometry Daily is a whole other world. Incredibly impressive work, please do take a look.

Thanks for listening.
