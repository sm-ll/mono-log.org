The first of many uploads to come utilising the <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/nordmodularbook/fmalgorithms.htm" title="32 algorithms of the DX7 synthesizer, these are modelled in the Nord Modular ">32 algorithms of the DX7 synthesizer, these are modelled in the Nord Modular </a>as direct conversion made by <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/nordmodularbook/fmtonordmodular.htm" title="Wout Blommers">Wout Blommers</a>.

I have often wanted to own a DX7 and more so in recent times, and so you can imagine my joy when I found this <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/nordmodularbook/nm_book_toc.html" title="advanced programming website by James J Clark">advanced programming website by James J Clark</a>, which includes the DX7, among other emulations and synthesis techniques. This should keep me going for a little while.

Todays upload more specifically is simply 2 notes, occasionally released and pressed again. I think it sounds pretty decent.
