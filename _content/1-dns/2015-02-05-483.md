Finally getting some time to play about with the Kawai K1m again, amazing synth, really enjoy using it. It's a very different vibe to using the Volca Sample for example, and has more in keeping with the Dr T's KCS or the Alesis MMT-8, which I think would partner it well.

This upload is a 101 providing the 808-esque kick, and the 606 is provided support on the bd and tomsâ€¦the rest is Kawai K1.

Enjoy.
