So…its half way trough the year, blimey where did that time go.

Not only does this mean I have done 183 creations in my Nord Modular, this also means its…half…way…through…the…year!

Have you done all those plans you had hoped? Visited that family member you have been meaning to? Don't worry, I haven't managed the things I wanted to either. Tomorrow is another day, and tomorrow you can do those things…or you can do them now! Or maybe just after you dust the desk down, or put the hoover round. (such an English thing to say that), been there, and will be there again.

Yep, half way through the year is a scary place to be when you really think about it, but its also a really incredibly motivator to make the second part of the year better than the first part. Just think how you will feel 6 months from now.

So, to celebrate the scary half way point, I thought I would try something a little different, as if that hasn't been the name of the game so far, still, different is what I thought I would do.

Today I have been working on a track most of the day, and often as has been the case for many years now, I tend to get a bit anxious when sitting down to write a track. Its a very strange feeling and one you are perhaps quite surprised by.

I believe my main hang up with writing a track, is that my idea of what makes a track is sometimes to create something that is simple, that borders on sketch or loop, that has within it the excitement and roughness of a sketch or loop, but a high attention to the roughness.

It is hard to explain, but I will try my best.

You see, as a track goes, what excitements in listening versus creating and listening are often quite different things. Generally I enjoy lots of music, but I suppose I get very excited by the occasional track written by someone else that seems like the filler track on an album, the ending piece, the little ditty, and the intro that stays on a little longer than normal. I guess ultimately it is a balance of sound that basically feels magic to the ears. We all aim for it and we all probably fail to a certain degree in obtaining what we aim for. But thats ok, we get somewhere, just like half way through the year, we might have felt we have failed, but we still got here and being here is a great place to look back, and look forward in gaining that much needed and challenging perspective.

While working today on this track, I realised I wasn't as anxious as I would normally be. I guess I was keen to explore the Nord Modular in a new way. But it was really the point that I heard sounds that everything seemed to be ok, I felt good, it sounded interesting, exciting and new again.

I have been working in such a way with sound for so many years, in efforts to distance myself from certain working methods I used before. Partly through trying to reach new and interesting sounds to my ears, but also in a way to abstract the whole writing of music process. To almost kid myself of what I was actually doing in order to obtain different results than what I might have otherwise. For me this always removed the idea of writing music, and just had a feeling more akin to moving furniture around, something I enjoy actually. Its a bit cumbersome and much of the time is spent standing around looking at what to move next.

Today I wanted to ensure no sounds were put into the laptop, until the very last point of which I would bounce down, something I have yet to do. This means or the sounds would be coming from the Nord, directly into Ableton Live, another software I don't use and a first for me really. Its quite good actually, as if you didn't know that already, as was the experience of working in sound similar to how I would back in the 90's. I felt like a teenager again, it was all quite exciting.

So for todays halfway mark, I decided to create something using this method, only using EQ within Ableton Live, as apposed to the occasional EQ I might have used on the crap mixer I have and hate, as the additional element to the Nord Modular itself. Its two patches, split to the four outputs, running into Ableton to balance better.

I have to say it was a really rewarding way to work and one I wish I have gone back to years ago.

I believe the anxiety probably came from the feeling of not having actually written a track for years, that is in the way I used to. And so after a short while of experiencing some classic situations, such as Midi not working, controllers not working, having to reboot software to get things talking…I was away, and it was like old times, but with a new unexpected sound.

So the sound itself, is a little space age sounding. I am not sure why but I had the image of the old classic films set in the future or having a science fiction theme or feel to them. Everything seems familiar and yet through the passing of time, a new excitement is found within these old classics. Often they get better with age.

Todays sound also has what I always like in music, but rarely hear, is that knowledge that it is coming from equipment in a studio. It has a rawness to it, an edge to it. This sound is something that I can never quite describe, but find the most obvious moment it occurs is when the track ends and the synths roll on momentarily, either leaving open a note or slow dying away.

To me, they remind me of Detroit Techno and great films like the 1954 <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047573/" title="Them" target="_blank">Them</a>, a film you must watch you haven't already. They are remembered as old, but in a new day, they sound more futuristic than ever.

Thanks to everyone who has been listening into my uploads and has stuck with it through the variety of styles I had played with. I really appreciate your time and your support, its truly amazing and I seriously couldn't have got this far without you.

I hope to meet more of you, speak with more of you, and as always hope you enjoy tonights late night tired rambling.

See you on the other side of this year, and as always I hope you enjoy the upload.

Thanks.
