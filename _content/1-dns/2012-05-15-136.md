Todays upload is quite an exciting one for me, the reason being as it ticks a few little boxes I have in my mind, such as it is only a single patch running at a lovely 99% on the CPU, also I like how it sounds, it also uses the idea I have previously of emulating that looping feel that occurs when using samplers, but ultimately I learnt lots doing itâ€¦so I am very pleased indeed.

Todays upload also sounds as it does due to my recent thoughts about how artists have a tendency to develop their sound often to a level of complexity that often moves away from the more simpler, clinical sound that I love so much. Admittedly this is a little bit of a sweeping statement or generalisation, but from experience of artists I have the upmost respect from, I am often finding that it is some of their earliest work that appeals to me the most.

It could be easily said that these earlier works are liked more due to the nostalgia, although I am quite sure this is not really the case, partly due to my general perspective of nostalgia, but also as I have found that often I have sought out earlier works that I had yet to hear, to find again this earlier work had something more to offer me. Having said that, perhaps it is the era that I like, more than the earlier part of someones output, and I suppose in that respect nostalgia, or at least something similar, could be at play here.

Obviously as we develop, we perhaps might change our working process, or be influenced by new music, or move location or have a change in our life, all playing a huge influence on what we create. 

It is these sorts of thoughts about what makes a certain style in an artist, that reminds me of my realising what exactly it is in certain artists that I like so much, and what might have originally been a general like of all their work, over the years has perhaps altered slightly into liking more the specific areas of their work that were perhaps enjoyed on a more subconscious level the first times around.

I think ultimately although still enjoying much of the work from those I have always followed, I think the respect is perhaps greater than it might have initially been, as I am able to appreciate further the beautiful simplicity of their earlier works, being made so many years ago.

For me, I believe I will also maintain a level of simplicity, but wonder how my sound might differ as I to grow and develop through my life in general.

I hope you enjoy todays upload.
