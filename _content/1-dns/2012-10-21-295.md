Some swingy fuzzy dub textures for tonights upload, sitting somewhere between the dub sounds of previous uploads but with rather obvious Jan Jelinek and Andrew Peckler's sounds still seeping through after an amazing performance firmly in my mind.

I am quite enjoying the flapping brass sound that pops in and out. Its kind of fun and quirky and brings a small grin to my face.

I have also found a better way to record using the Inkel Mixer, as some of the previous upload were not using the EQ settings the same as I was hearing it, resulting in some quite annoying and dead sound compared the life this little Inkel can bring. So hopefully things will be little better balanced than before.

Lastly, there was some interesting blundering from the Nord near the end of this upload, where I think it was trying to work out what filter type to pick as I moved the dial quickly between. I am not quite sure what it was doing but I like how it sounds. I will be looking into this some more. 

I hope you enjoy tonights upload.
