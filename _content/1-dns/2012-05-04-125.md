While during the creation of todays upload, many of them actually, I often find they take on a much more agressive quality than they do when listening back to them. I partly feel this comes from where my mind is at the time, from thoughts of inspiration, familiarity and musical context, to listening volume, and even complexity of the patch has an affect.

A loyal listener of this blog remarked that <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_124/" title="yesterdays upload">yesterdays upload</a> reminded them of a particular Jan Jelinek work, and upon listening to it again I would have to agree it does share some similarity, although perhaps not in mood, but in the sounds texture. This for me reasserted again how much we relate to a track is governed from our perspective and how that first engagement occurs.

When listening back to todays upload, I am repositioned in my relation to it, and again surprised by the tranquility of it in comparison to how I remembered it moments ago when creating it. What initial seemed as a adjustment of parameters to quieten the mood during the sketch, is now heard more as a subtle variation in sound whilst the rest of the sketch seems to maintain much of its mood. This reminds me of the power of influence a turning of a dial can have when hearing its result as it is turned.

Again, an upload that was initially thought of as something quite hard and aggressive, unlike me (whatever that is?), and something that would perhaps only exist as a sketch on this blog, is now being seriously considered as one of the possible sketches for the label sm-ll, that I will be beginning sometime this year.

I hope that until we reach the first days of sm-ll's beginning, that todays upload is something you can enjoy and that might wet your appetite of what is to come.
