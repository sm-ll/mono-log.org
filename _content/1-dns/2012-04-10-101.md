For todays upload I have created something I have threatened to do for some years now, and although the style of todays upload is a little on the 'roar roar' side for my taste, this is exactly the sort of sound or groove I might have begun with, to then filter down or reduce in some way, to find that balance of Techno that is so tricky to achieve.

For me it was often a case of getting noisy first, before things could calm down. Generally I have always been more of fan of those tracks that tend to sit as in-between tracks, fillers if you like. This of course is from the perspective of the mid 90's and not present day delivery of techno which I must admit having lost track of. Having said that, it was recent Techno that finally spurred me on to begin exploring the techno framework I love so much, and so hopefully on occasion I will upload where I am with it all, as I slowly refine it to somewhere handy.

Todays upload has a bit of that squashed sound I have a love hate relationship in reagards to Techno, but feel as a 'starting' point its all good. I will stop trying to justify what I have done…haha.

I must say I have heard some exceptionally good things of late that has been quite exciting, the recent<a href="http://www.t2x.eu/geotope/" title=" Geotope album by Sendai" target="_blank"> Geotope album by Sendai</a>, and also more recently <a href="http://www.residentadvisor.net/review-view.aspx?id=10722" title="Shifted - Crossed Paths" target="_blank">Shifted - Crossed Paths</a> on Luke Slaters label, <a href="http://www.mote-evolver.com/" title="Mote Evolver" target="_blank">Mote Evolver</a>

Todays upload is probably not for everyone, although I am finding more and more those who like certain aspects of what I make or the music I listen to, seem to have been into Techno at some point if not still now. I believe there is some hidden structure to how the sounds are used, or the goals in the sounds delivery, that are still slightly present in some electronic music of very different genres.

Anyway…I hope you enjoy it.
