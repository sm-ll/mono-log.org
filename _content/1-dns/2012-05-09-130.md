Today is an early morning upload that has delivered something that really hoped to use the late hours to create something simplistic, exploring the edges of sound creation that are always hard to find for me. What has come out is something of a rough, sketchy hybrid of previous uploads, taking a simple form of pattern and texture.

At this early hour where I even struggle to find the right words, I am intrigued by what possible feel this upload will have on future listens with fresher ears.

I certainly feel I am ever so slightly closer to something I have in mind, but still many steps away from completely getting it where I want, and generally believe where it eventually ends up, to be somewhere that perhaps a very different sound on the surfaceâ€¦I guess once again only time will tell.

After a long day of many discussions with many people, creating drafts of future plans of Sm-ll, I am feeling as you can imagine pretty exhausted, and so bid you good night for those who share the same time as mine, and hopefully an enjoyable listen for all.
