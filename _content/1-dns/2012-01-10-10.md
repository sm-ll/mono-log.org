I have recently found the amazing photography work of Berlin based and self-taught photographer <a href="http://www.matthias-heiderich.de/" title="Matthias Heiderich">Matthias Heiderich</a>. Matthias demonstrates an incredible sense of space in his framing and choice of subject, and the colour he extracts and presents in his images is remarkable. This is the sort of work I love so much, and reminds me of some <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/two_point_two/" title="early 12k sleeves designs, particularly the compilation Two Point Two">early 12k sleeves designs, particularly the compilation Two Point Two</a>, my second ever purchase from that label and introduction to the <a href="http://www.lineimprint.com/" title="incredible Line label">incredible Line label</a>.

Picking a particular photo for todays upload was pretty much impossible as all Matthias’s work is incredible, so I have chosen just two from his series called ‘<a href="http://www.matthias-heiderich.de/photos/index.php?/2011/new-ones/" title="Studie Drei">Studie Drei</a>’, as feel these are perhaps the most fitting to todays post.

Due in part to a period of influence and self confirming taste and style back around 2000, 2003, I have decided to create something for todays sound that in a small way reflects what I might hear in my mind 'now', when I see such imagery or experience such buildings myself. 

This sound and todays upload, is loosely based on a previous sound I created inspired by a field recording taken by <a href="http://www.yannnovak.com/" title="Yann Novak">Yann Novak</a> for the collaborative project found on the recent and free downloadable anual celebration of the label and artists called '<a href="http://www.dragonseyerecordings.com/catalogue/de6010.html" title="Iron">Iron</a>'. The sound in question wasn't used in the end, and not wanting to upload material from last year, I created something from scratch with this process and sound also in mind.
