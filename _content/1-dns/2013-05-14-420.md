A very quick post as I wanted to share something after a long day of work in my final week. Three more days and I have time to work on SM-LL… at long last. 

A selection of some of the Roland CR-78 drum sounds quickly emulated in the Nord Modular G1 this evening, running through a new delay unit that found its way to our studio.

Enjoy.
