Today I have been busy working on bringing some new features to mono-log, and also giving it a slight design tweak while im at it. This will hopefully makes things a little prettier for you when you visit, but also better for listening to older posts. I have been meaning to do this for a while but have been busy, though I am pleased that now things are getting a little closer to implementing these ideas…baby steps as they say.

Considering todays busy schedule I have quickly reworked yesterdays upload into something that is a little more textured with softer melodic touches, I think its sound comes from me listening to <a href="http://unrecnow.com/dust/about" title="Marcus Fischer" target="_blank">Marcus Fischer</a> a little bit earlier today.

Keeping Marcus in mind, I quickly took a Fischer-esque photo of my little set-up, there are a few bits under the table that you can't see. But seeing this now in a photo, it really shows how little equipment I have these days…gone are the days of a studio full of analogue gear and large 24 track mixers…still I would sooner have a shoebox in place of the mixer I am using at the moment.

Enjoy todays upload :)
