A simple sound and sticking down of a few notes for todays clean sounding upload. Simple tones with a touch of EQ, using the<a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/nordmodularbook/fmalgorithms.htm" title=" DX7 operator algorithm 1"> DX7 operator algorithm 1</a> in the Nord.

It is quite 'nice' sounding, but could perhaps be used as a starting point for something else.

Also a new format of images to be included, coming from the ever popular <a href="http://instagr.am/" title="Instagram">Instagram</a>, so expect more images of my life, the studio and various other joys I hope.

Also another change comes in a slight revamp of this blog as I improve the design, it is not a huge change and I am going to do my best to keep things roughly where you expect them, and by doing a little bit whenever I can, I will hopefully get it nearer a 'finished' state.

Finally, as some of you might already know, me and Lucia will be performing at <a href="http://www.oboro.net/archive/exhib1112/05_sublimation/info_en.html" title="Oboro in Canada on the 3rd of Mach">Oboro in Canada on the 3rd of Mach</a>, so will be away from the 28th of Feb for a week and wont have access to my Nord Modular. What I have decided in doing, is a second creation each day until we leave. To keep the work load manageable, these sounds are going to be simple variations of what you hear 'this' week. What this means is that I have to do two sounds a day in preparation for thisâ€¦phew! 

Wish me luck.
