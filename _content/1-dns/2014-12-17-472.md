House, What is house?
Technotronic, KLF, Or something you live in?
To me, House is Phuture.
Pierre, Fingers, Adonis etc.
The pioneers of the hypnotic groove.
Brian Eno, Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode and the yellow magic orchestra.
This album is dedicated to you.
House.
In the future, We hope our music will bring everyone a little closer together,
Gay, Straight, Black or white, One nation under a groove.
