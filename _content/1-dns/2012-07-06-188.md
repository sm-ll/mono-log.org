So it's Friday night and the build up to the weekend, of which part of it, the Saturday, me and Lucia will be attending <a href="http://www.blocweekend.com/" title="Bloc" target="_blank">Bloc</a>, which are both very much looking forward to. Incidentally if anyone reading this is also going, please say hello if you see us.

So as it is Blocweekend, and also because I've wanted to for some years now, I have created some proper Techno music for todays upload. I spent some of my afternoon working on a Roland TR909 kick type sound, and am pretty pleased with how it turned out.

What I am really enjoying about this Nord Modular and with many of the uploads in this blog, is the idea of creating sounds, tracks or ideas that are in clear reference to something else, whether that's a another sound, piece of equipment, artist or specific track. I find our tendency is to try to sound always original and shy away from openly copying someone else. We tend to find a balance in our mind of it being considered more a reference or inspiration of another than mere copying of it. 

And perhaps it is.

Its not that I am proposing we actually copy someone else identically and present that as our own, although that might be interested, but more that we copy someone else in the creative process for the sole reason to put us somewhere we wouldn't normally be in terms of 'how' we create. As we attempt to copy, the creative process will change a great deal fro what we normally might do, and soon we have infront of us sounds that are closely resembling something or someone else but with settings that are unique to us. With simple changes in those settings what would sound similar one moment is quickly changed to something else. Our journey getting there is one full of new paths that we wouldn't have perhaps explored.

I think as with anything there is a line that one should fall the correct side of in given situations. A line that supports the similarities something might have to something else one side, and disapproves of the similarities the other for the reason of, well it sounds to similar.

Thinking of this from another perspective, there are many times I have created something and had someone else listen and say something along the lines of “oh this sounds just like…”, and often it does. A different perspective, a different set of ears and experience with music will listen differently. So when thinking like this, I quite like the idea of creating something quite clearly in emulation of something else, but having that slight difference, as it will, that because of this context sounds all the more interesting. The Roland TR909 kick that sounding slightly different, as its actually a Nord Modular for example, and if all the sounds are slightly different, very quickly to my ears at least, it sounds like a new set of classic sounds. Certain types of sounds seem to be in the places we recognise them to be, they play the role they are given, and yet sound slightly different and out of place. 

I think this approach is a good one personally. Having something very close to an 'original', really shows how different it is, and the ears tue in harder, hold onto subtleties all the more, and I believe as a result things will sound different.

What do you think?

How often do you feel comfortable saying something you made was trying to copy someone or something else?

I hope you enjoy todays track, I gotta say I am quite enjoying it. Its scrappy, sounds like the people who I am inspired by and yet sound like something else at the same time.
