Tonights upload revisits some previous ideas around pulsar synthesis, and although this is not pulsar synthesis, it does share however some of the ideas of one sound influencing or controlling another, creating a sort of folding of frequencies.

This is one small patch, consisting mainly of Sine shaped LFO's controlling the amplitude shape of Square shaped LFO's, with the addition of a few Envelopes and Filters to influence further shaping over time.

I really like the cyclic nature of these sorts of sounds, and find if done well, although repetitive, seem able to play for reasonable lengths before becoming tiresome. 

Perhaps this is just me.

I hope you enjoy.
