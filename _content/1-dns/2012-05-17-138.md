Todays upload is perhaps one for fans of such sounds as those found in Mark Fells recent output, a fiercely repetitive quality, bright and buzzy.

I do find while listening to this, after the initial attack subsides, there is much to be calm about. A slow revolving movement of shape if the left channel, contrasted in the right with the more rapid cyclic patterns in high frequencies, pull the ears in to different levels of engagement and and for me shifts it from sounding much like Mark Fell at all.

Whilst making todays upload, I was reminded of creating similar sketchs many years ago, when I was listening to the more repetitive sections found in some mid career Autechre work. I remember it was not long after buying my Nord Micro Modular, the smaller sister of what I own now, that I experimented with much the way I used it today, and as a result found this high paced repetition, bordering on texture, to be something quite interesting. The sounds back then perhaps leant slightly more towards Autechre in the balance of frequencies than todays. I never received much enthusiasm from those I played them to, which I can totally understand, obviously it is not exactly an easy listen for most. This sort of meant I left my experiments as that, and it has only just dawned on me today whilst I was suggested to use the Nord in a kind of plug about and see what happens approach, that this similarity is sound was found, and reminded me of a time past.

A few kind followers of this blog also recently reminded me once again of the importance of having like minded and supportive people around you, something I can't say I really had when creating music many years ago. This is certainly one great advantage of the internet and its connectivity, as we all know, although similarly a burden for many of us too. Personally I see far more positives.

I hope todays upload is interesting, if not your tasteâ€¦enjoy.
