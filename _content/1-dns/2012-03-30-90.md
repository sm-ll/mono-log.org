After a long day working on websites, and then on some future projects with my partner Lucia , the day has slipped by falling into the early hours, and todays upload still hasn't been done. 
So todays Nord adventure is going to be something of an early morning creation, created with sleepy tired minds, which I must say has something nice about it.

I have decided to call in Lucia to help out, and to also use this opportunity to try something different with todays upload. 
The way it works is this; Lucia has began the creation of todays sound and taken it to a point she is happy, then I have taken over where she has left off and completed it, from how I felt when listening to it.

We have both been enjoying the new <a href="http://www.t2x.eu/geotope-is-out-now-on-vinyl/" title="Sendai album today titled Geotope, released on Time To Express" target="_blank">Sendai album today titled Geotope, released on Time To Express</a>, so I feel clearly that has inspired us both today.
If you haven't got this album yet, do so, it is a winner.

I hope you enjoy todays sound, it is quite different. :)
