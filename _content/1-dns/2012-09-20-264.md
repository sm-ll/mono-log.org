Recently me and Lucia have been working material on our Saturday performance at the event <a href="http://sho-zyg.com/" title="Sho-Zyg" target="_blank">Sho-Zyg</a>.

Its been a while since me and Lucia have worked together and it has been an interesting experience moving into the mode and sounds of Mimosa Moize.

I can't say we are totally where we left off, but then neither do we think we should be. As time has passed and we have done different things, to expect or desire to be at the point at which we left it, would be sort of going backwards. What is left then is an exciting unknowing for the event to come.

Tonights upload although sounding very different to what we have been working on, has in some way been influenced by it. 

If you are unable to come watch us perform and it hopefully goes well, we might share the recording if we do one. Otherwise I hope you enjoy this upload.
