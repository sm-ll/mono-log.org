It snowed last night.

Today I awoke to a beautiful peaceful morning. The sound of melting snow dripping from where it have fallen the night before. I watched children playing in the distance yet unable to hear them, their sounds being blanketed by the whiteness.
The slight sounds of the city hum, the planes, the distant cars all still there, yet today all seemingly respectful of the city they so normally would fill with noise.

Today I was reminded why I want to live in a snowy land.
Today I experienced something quiet.
