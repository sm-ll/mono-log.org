So tomorrow and Sunday me and Lucia are in Malmö/Copenhagen to meet with Finn Albertsson, owner of the record label SonuoS and Dj at Culture Box.

As I am not sure if I will have internet, and certainly know I will not have my Nord ModuIar, so I have created my upload today and am writing this post now, Friday night.

Its a 4:30AM start, so I will make this short as its likely to be around 36hours before I will see or feel a pillow again. Can't wait, very excited indeed.

Enjoy the upload.
