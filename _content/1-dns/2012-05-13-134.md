Some more late evening exploration in patterns using the logic modules in the Nord Modular, and getting ever closer to a something exciting I feel.

Today has mostly been a day of challenges of perspective, determination and focus on the future, which I must say for all its challenges it has delivered many positives that I am largely appreciative of.

Some days seem full of chances to realise such things, and I think for a moment partly inspired by someone else words, wondering how much I might miss what falls outside my current perspective.

Friends I have made and met, and people I respect and have yet to meet are continuing to inspire and shed a much needed light on my idea of a future in some many areas, and as a result I am very much exciting and determined on the events in the near future.

I hope tonights upload is enjoyable, it is a crunchy and noisy sketch, and although perhaps as I listen to it tonight I hear many flaws, it does stand as a likely contributor in cementing an idea.
