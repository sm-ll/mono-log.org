So after what was a tiring and frustrating day yesterday, today has turned out to be the total opposite. Isn't that often the case? 

Firstly I awoke to be offered to start a new job contract in the new year, which means full steam ahead with my label Sm-ll, very pleased.

Also, I finally got my Dynacord to work after researching online and prodding around inside while it was turned on. I cured the issue that was causing the buzz and also the various other problems. Happy again :)

After all this wait I am very pleased to be sharing an idea, sketch, track, whatever you might like to call it, that uses the Dynacord.

The main thing I enjoy about buying and using a new bit of equipment, is not so much the addition of its sound, but more what it does to the creativity in the studio all round, and I think todays upload is a good example of this.

Immediately I found the sounds I have made just sound different, and this seems to happen even without the Dynacord being used on these sounds. They just had what I can only describe as this Dynacord-like sound. I just had this desire to get everything else to sound just as crazy as this machine, and yet again the Nord Modular was able to support it and deliver something that surprised me.

I am spoilt.

Todays upload is all brand new patches based very loosely on the sounds in the TR-808. A boomy sine tone bass drum, a snappy and tone like snare, and a cowbell patch that I looked up in an issue of <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Sep02/articles/synthsecrets09.asp" title="Sound on Sound and their very useful Synth Secrets">Sound on Sound and their very useful Synth Secrets</a> series. This patch was changed quite a bit though as quite frankly the one they provide sounds nothing like an 808 cowbell which was a bit disappointing. 

Incidentally Synth Secret is a series well worth reading, although from my experience all the patches are not very good sounding, but there is lots to learn in them and the supporting writing also.

So, the Dynacord features in this upload more as a chorus/flange like effect than a full on delay/reverb, and is used more to create some interesting resonances and stereo imaging, although I couldn't resist turning some dials while I jammed this sketch.

Yeah really pleased with this machine, and its is exactly what I needed to support the more textured and crunchy Space Echo.

Incidentally, I <a href="https://soundcloud.com/moize/dynacord" title="uploaded a quick jam earlier today to my soundcloud">uploaded a quick jam earlier today to my soundcloud</a> testing out the Dynacord and sing more the delay time features. This upload is only using the TR-606 Low Tom sound but really shows off the machine well I think.

I hope you enjoy it.
