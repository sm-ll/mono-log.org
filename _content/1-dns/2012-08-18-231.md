Some more experiments in creating rhythmical repetition with as few rhythm sounds as I can, and additionally working in the muted bass textures that I have always enjoyed.

For this experiment I used some TB303-esque sounds, creating a sort of long sustaining boing quality. Taking it away slightly form the classic 303, and asking myself what would it do if it could do something else than the obvious.

I think there is certainly some early Plastikman influence in this, although I am not sure where, perhaps that boing quality, or sustained detuning.

I will certainly be coming back to this, so I hope you enjoy it.
