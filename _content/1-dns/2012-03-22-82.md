Sleepy, slow late night synth modulation. 

I always find these kind of sounds difficult to balance EQ wise due to the constant movement of frequencies and resonance, and generally find them having to go through a few more processes, outboard, fx or in the computer, to really get them where I like them. As tempting as it might have been I have stuck to the Nord Modular and the very basic EQ on my mini desk, which is such a poor mixer, one I really hate, that I wont even mention it by name, simply if you have ever had a bad mixer, you know the brand :)

Still, this upload does have some nice pops and movements in it, even if a little heavy and hard sounding.

Enjoyâ€¦
