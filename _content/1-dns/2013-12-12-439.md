Tonights upload is inspired massively by the incredible release on 12k by Antti Rannisto titled <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/aanniesineita/" target="_blank">Ääniesineitä</a>.

I am not sure what Antti Rannisto is doing these days, but whatever it is, I think he should be doing it for <a href="http://www.sm-ll.com" target="_blank">SM-LL</a>. So in the future I would like to make that happen.

For me personally, this is one of the strongest releases on 12k, perhaps due to its uniqueness for that label, but also I can't say I have heard anything like it before, or since, and that is a very special thing.

My upload pales by comparison, and was a quick sketch I made before heading out this evening. Creating it was very enjoyable and is certainly something I have been dying to do since beginning these uploads.

As many of you know, I have often mentioned earlier releases of 12k, and this one has come up many times, however I have never really created something with this so much in my mind.

Creating something so close to something else, may seem like a pointless thing to do for some. I couldn't disagree more. If you have yet to do it, I suggest you do so. You will not only learn so much more about sound, the creation process, and how you feel about it while creating, but also develop a new appreciation for the things you love.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload.
