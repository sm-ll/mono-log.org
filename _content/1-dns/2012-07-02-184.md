So, today has been a great day. I finished off a track I had been working on and I gotta say it was really amazing fun doing it.

Its been a long time since I have been working in such a way. Stood up, nodding my head and turning dials. It really took me back to when I was a teenager, writing lots of dub infused electronica with my trusty TR-606, SH-101, Juno-60 all plugged into my Roland Space Echo. Balancing grooves, delays and resonant subtle melodies.

I was always stood up around this time of creating, always. In fact every single studio I had in those days was wired to be stood up. I developed the studio and filled Racks and A-frames with synths and analogue equipment. And although I did start running Cubase on the Atari STE, and would sit doen for a few moments to program, generally it was a few loops, and sitting down seemed pretty boring for a youngster used to grooving about with sliders and dials.

Eventually, I set up a studio that would see the first PC computer running plugins an various other bits of software. For me this was a long and difficult transition and my best work from around that time was jamming basic ideas into tracks using the mixer and outboard. Rarely was I satisfied with tracks created entirely in the computer.

It wasn't until years later that i found ways to jam using the computer and hardware combinations, and would set up basic systems that would work with little input. But although pleased with these works, the way of working had changed, and sitting, thinking, and processing took up the majority of the work.

So today, it has been amazing to use what I have learnt over the years, and apply it to the old methods I am so familiar with. Using emotion to drive an idea, using energy, enthusiasm, and passion. All concepts that had left me long ago. I have to not for bad reasons, but as a journey, moving from the soul, to the mind, and today was a reminder of the passion of the soul again…it really was great.

So for todays upload I pondered making something basic as being a little burned out from the long day, but could feel that late night emergence of Techno that I was so familiar with as a kid.

It was totally jammed, is two patches with no external EQ at all, and sounds somewhere between Surgeons old work, combined with Robert Hood and perhaps some early Christian Vogel…and me as a teenager haha.

Anyway, I am rambling, I hope you enjoy it. I am perhaps as surprised as some of you in uploading techno to this blog. But as a good friend has often said “it is what it is”

Enjoy.
