So yesterday after I created something for the upload, I had an idea to work on another pseudo delay within the Nord Modular. Unlike the G2 Nord, the G1 that I am using doesn't have any real effects to speak of, and although a bit of a shame, it does encourage the making of effects.

I have sort of looked at making delays before using delayed triggers, but this time I decided to work on using a combination of envelopes for overall amplitude of the delay and a shorter set for the actual delay itself. It works pretty good actually. It isn't an actually delay, but more a kind of modulation of the original signal.

However, this is not what I wanted to talk about. It is something that happened while making this upload that has resulted in a perspective that you can see in the photo below…a perspective of my ceiling.

So while creating this pseudo delay, a patch I am happy to share should anyone want it, my back started aching as I was so engrossed in the Nord, I was sat a little awkward.

Today when I woke up, I felt very enthusiastic, ready to get on with some work, but decided to quickly hoover before I did so. A clean house, a clean mind.

The my back gave out…

So today I have been laid up, flat on my back, in quite a bit of pain and the occasional back muscle spasm seemingly thrown in for some amusement…not mind generally.

I have been racking my brain today asking myself how I would able to do todays upload, or any uploads for the days to come. I first thought I could just sit out the pain and get on with it, but as anyone who has had a back pain, this just is not possible. I did try though…it didn't work and I lasted I think 10 minutes. 

Plan B was I would use the G2 demo, freely available form the Nord website. This demo allows me create a Nord patch using the sound of the computer. It isn't form the Nord, but a similar ballpark, I figured I could do this lying down with my laptop…it didn't work on my Macbook Pro 10.8.

So, while thinking I would have to get up and move my older laptop and unplug things form the studio set-up, I realised I could easily just lie on the floor next to my equipment, and still use the actual Nord…win.

So…Plan C, lying down, with an old broken NS10 monitor and some cushions as a head rest, laptop, and long cables, perfect way to create an upload, perfect but a bit painful. :)

So I have managed to create something, and stood at the end while I tweaked a little on the Inkel while recording. Oddly enough I am able to stand not to bad.

Anyway, a long story, and probably quite a boring one in all honesty, but alas anyone who knows what a bad back is like, boring is a norm. Still, the painkillers make it amusing from time to time.

I hope you enjoy todays upload.
