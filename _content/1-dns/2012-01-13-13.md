I am forever blown away by what the Nord Modular can do. Even after thirteen mornings of working with the Nord on a more regular basis, I am still able to find some inspiration in its sounds, finding their interaction a wonderful listening experience. 

There always seems a level of excellence, of extraordinary detail in its sound that I can’t say I have ever experienced in any other synth, and as a result it is such a joy to create with. Even how the volume alters the sound when quickly turned down is slightly unusual, creating a sort of washed out resonant fuzz, almost as if some dust has settled into the dial in a perfectly measured way…amazing really.

Again, as I think into the future to New Years Day 2013, I am very excited at the prospect of what sounds there will be to listen back to. I have even started to consider making each sound of such a style, that I can easily listen to them all without having to move to the volume dial in fear of a particular noisy one. So already a form is taken place in consideration to the listening back experience. Suffice to say I am really enjoying the experience and particularly this sound creation this morning.

Also as part of this upload, another incredible and hopefully fitting photo is again coming from <a href="http://www.matthias-heiderich.de/photos/index.php?/2011/snow-blind/" title="Matthias Heiderich">Matthias Heiderich</a>, this time from his Snow Blind series, all amazing work, please do take the time to look at his work.

Finally, please do be careful with the volume when listening to these sounds, and in particular this one. Your ears might feel a little fuzzy after listening to its on headphones or at louder volumes on speakers, although this is quite normal, just be careful, as always.
