As mentioned in yesterdays post, I wanted to create something that explores more the specific qualities of the Pulse module found on the Nord Modular. Although I have been using this module in most uploads so far, I have had in my mind an area of sound that I have been experimenting with for a few years now, and wanted to share this sound with you today.

I feel there are a collection of reasons why this type of sound that interests me, the interference of sounds heard around afterwards, the interconnected relationship of sound to pattern and placement, the repetition, and the experience of being able to dig out more qualities in the sounds the more it is listened to.

Although all of these reasons are great, I think the main reason I gravitate to these types of sounds, is through a general lack of experiencing them in many places. Its not to say my sound is original or any bold claim like that, not that originality is something I am all that bothered with, but when thinking of all the other multiples of repetitive styles of music that arguably share very similar aesthetics, by comparison I just don't get to hear this sort of thing in as many places.

I think we often have a powerful desire to inject into what we create a recognition, a familiarity, a belonging, to something that we can already trust. This could exist in the way sound feels, its energy, its proposed context, its balance according to what we consider 'correct'. I feel we decide upon our likes and dislikes through a sort of almost instinctive check list determining our taste. Does that bass sound tight? Do the hats sit right? Does that chord sound weak? Is it supposed to sound weak? â€¦a constant back and forth seeking a balance between playing safe and forward thinking and innovation.

I feel for me, I like to think of my check list specifically, and think of it as existing in layers. At the route level I like to see what unlikely combinations could work together and through the creating of multiple sketches, I can begin to fabricate another higher level check list, its route is undeniably from inspiration and influence, but this route sits below. This higher level check list I think of a little bit like coding, or any structuring of language. We sometimes can't digest or understand it at its core level, so we abstract it, or create a higher level that we can more easily manage. I find creating this higher level enables me to find confidence in sounds, to find focus in decision making and goals. This further abstraction from its source level provokes an interesting and unlikely collision and connection of sounds and ideas, and I feel that is what todays upload represents.

A great deal of thoughts here that I have put down for the first time today, as is often the case with this blog. As always I hope there is something that is inspiring to those who read these entries. Also I hope perhaps this provides some insight into why things sound as they do.

As always, I ultimately hope you enjoy the upload, as listening to this can often say far more than any amount of writing can.
