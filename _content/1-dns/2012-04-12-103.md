I have posted before about the creative process of electronic that I feel in some way spills over from Techno music. Admittedly this can be considered an extremely subjective perspective, which I can't ignore. However, considering again that many of these artists have also some history in Techno music, and also the technology used in creating Techno music largely governed how that music was written, and really through that creative structure of the technology formed that same music, it also suggests that a structure that also informs partly what is good or not, or what is accepted as that genre, is also going to be used in gauging developments of that music or creative structure.

What is considered as good, for example, is going to be evaluated on what has come before, what is now and what is wished for it to become. An evaluation of structure or genre substantiality, equated using a framework from another.

This reminds me such experiences of the cover version or remake. An initial version is sometimes experienced as the preferred, or sometimes the one in which the others are based upon. I often find it confusing in how to evaluate something that I understand has been done previously in some other form, an 'original' a book or often the worst cases of remakes in those that are simply for a want for a universal language, whatever that is supposed to mean.

I am very much interested in how something is understood when presented along with the consideration of something else, a suggestive element perhaps or a presentation to provoke a comprehension of influence, structure, history or some other aspect that might have informed the status quo, even when not an actual influence.

For me there is also a question of language within the structure of a said piece of music, and perhaps that is a language that is really one heard through our own experience of something more than that which was in play from the actual creator. After all it is often the creator that is the last to hear their own influences, the last to hear 'their sound'. So who really knows, so perhaps all that can be said for sure is that something is evaluated based on something stated at the time, an anchor that is used to feed off and bounce against in determining how we feel about something.

â€¦

Some complex and convoluted thoughts this evening, but I hope you can get my drift. Although my hope is if my babble is to much, the upload is enjoyable :)
