Today I have been listening back to some of the previous uploads while giving our studio a much needed clean. While doing this I noticed how much I was enjoying the sound of the Roland TR-606 styled sounds I had created in the Nord Modular, and thought to do something in that area once again for tonights upload.

As before, I thought to use the actual 606 to get some ideas rolling before I starting patching, only to find all the patterns had been changed into frantic rhythms, basically alternating every sound with the next. A bass drum might be 1, 3, 5, 7 etc while the next sound was 2, 4, 6, 8 etc. It so happened that the sounds turned up were only that of the bass drum, toms and hats. 

I can only guess the internal battery is a bit old, or I pressed something that reset all the patches to some default. Well, default or faulty battery, it sounded great. 

Thank you again Roland :)

Using this accidental finding of the 606 pattern, I decided to create something replicating this in part in the Nord Modular environment.

While tweaking the sounds once again, I compared with the original 606 only to find the combination of patterns from the Nord Modular and the 606 to be too tempting to leave, so I replicated this in part again completely in the Nord Modular.

Along with some reverb textures form the Roland Space Echo and some rolling delay from the Dynacord, I jammed this track out live on the desk and some assigned dials to tweak some sounds in the Modular.

I have done a few other similar styled tracks to this one, and I have to say I really enjoy making them. It somehow sits in between a very frantic track and a very calming one, at least to my earsâ€¦how does it sound to yours?

I really love the sound of the 606, and can never quite get the Nord Modular to sound as good, but it makes up for it in layering or tweaking.

I hope you enjoy this one as I certainly enjoying making it.

Thanks for listening and I hope you have been having a great Boxing Day.
