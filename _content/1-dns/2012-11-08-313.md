For those of you who have followed this blog for a while (I thank you), you might remember Finn from a <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_105/" title="previous post">previous post</a>, as I was first introduced to him back in March by the ever supportive, friendly and talented <a href="http://www.knobsounds.com/" title="Yves De May">Yves De May</a>, whom I met through this blog.

Finn and SonuoS have supported me in making my first release happen, and I am very happy about it. Did I mention it is white vinyl? Its a beautiful looking thing. :)

I am very much looking forward to the approaching releases on SonuoS and the future for this label is very exciting indeed.

So for tonights upload, due to my nicely relaxed mind, comes a slightly more ambient take on the Pokk! sound. This is basically two very similar patches, one running through the Roland Space Echo, the other with a slight addition of Inkel delay delight. I really love my Inkel mixer.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload, and if you would like to support my first release, please do support Finn and all the other artists at SonuoS. I believe Subwax Bcn are re-doing their website, but <a href="http://www.discogs.com/sell/list?release_id=3848622&ev=rb" title="you can buy it here.">you can buy it here.</a>

Thanks again everyone for listening and your support. Its been amazing as always.
