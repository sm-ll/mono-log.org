Another pulse experiment and a want to keep things ultra simple was this mornings goal, and I feel I have got there with this raw and repetitive pulse with subtle planning on the mixer.

I really like the feeling I get from interesting sounds as they shift and move through the simplest of alterations, and have found much of the experimenting I have done with pulse like sounds has always been a joy to my ears and mind.

I appreciate this sound might not deliver the same sensations for most people, and many might conclude it is nothing new or nothing great, but I am not one for originality nor for it to be taken so literally, ultimately I just can't help but like this sort of sound. 

The feeling this sound gives me again reminds me of <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/artists/antti_rannisto/" title="Antti Rannisto" target="_blank">Antti Rannisto</a>, someone I have mentioned on Mono-log a few times and who I highly recommend. And although Antti Rannisto has a sound that is very different in many ways, it is that same excitement and unease when listening to his work that I feel I aim for when making my own sounds.
