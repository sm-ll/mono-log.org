If you wondering to yourself how amazingly close the Nord Modular sounds to a TB-303 and TR-606, well that would be because todays upload is a TB-303 and TR-606.

After spending the day listening to Plastikman's Consumed, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/repeatle" title="Andreas Tilliander">Andreas Tilliander</a>'s new album <a href="http://www.kontra-musik.com/" title="TM-404">TM-404</a>, I thought with todays arrival of the TB-303, I should do a bit of a tribute before getting into some Pokk! sounds.

Today's upload is really in reference to TM-404, and an amazing album it is. TM-404 is out on Jan 30th on the excellent <a href="http://www.kontra-musik.com/" title="Kontra Musik">Kontra Musik</a> label, who were very kind in passing me a copy of this gem before release date. Thanks Finn for sorting this out :)

Using the 303 today was a huge sensual experience, one I have not had since using this machine, very machine actually, probably some 14 or so years ago.

The biggest part of this is hearing such a classic sound, and feeling the power in turning a dial. I can't say I have had this experience in quite such magnitude as with the 303.

I have said in previous posts, that might attention has never been to the 303, always finding this machine to be a bit of a one trick pony. I am prepared to take that remark back.

Although at the time, previously, this was very much the case, today however, has brought my ears to a whole new dimension to the potential of the TB-303, and one I owe in part to Plastikman's Consumed, but more specifically and recently to that of TM-404.

It is this sound and use of such classic machines in TM-404, along with my own exploration through this blog, that has been key in reminding me of a sound I once had back in the beginning. A stripped back, 606 dub delayed sound, that still stands as some of my most favourite creations to date.

I hope you enjoy todays upload, and do buy TM-404 on Kontra Musik, its an amazing album, and with track titles such as 303/303/303/303/606â€¦you can see why it is a favourite of mine. 

Equally, if you like TM-404, Andrea's has also remixed me as Mokira, on my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sonuos.records" title="Pokk! EP release through SonuoS">Pokk! EP release through SonuoS</a>. Obviously his remix is pretty special and I am pretty happy it happened the way it did. I hope I get to work with Andrea's sometime in the near future.

Enjoy the upload.

(Update: Almost forgot to thank my good friend Scott Green for the lending us of the TB-303. We did a <a href="http://soundcloud.com/nanonanouk/vcs-1996" title="track together one weekend">track together one weekend</a> using this very machine back in 1996. Go have a listen. I think Jeff Mills might have been an inspiration.)
