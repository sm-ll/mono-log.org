We often create structures, systems, frameworks, limitations to organise ourselves or allow and encourage a greater creativity. Without these limits we flounder, we have no sense of direction or purpose, no clear way of identifying what is us.

We might think we take things as we come and not rely on systems or any such thing, but our daily cycle of waking, functioning and sleeping is an essential structure to our very well being.

It is my belief that embracing such structures, attaching oneself in a purposeful relationship to these structures, feeling like we can belong and give in to them, that we can then open and explore beyond them.

Repetition is such a structure. Is connects itself to itself to itself to itself. And yet it creates something else through its connections. Its simplicity is no longer simple through a connection to it. It becomes normal.

I want to do less, so I can do more.
