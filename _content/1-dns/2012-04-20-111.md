First off, I hope you like the new and slightly improved website design. I have been looking at this design for so long now it is hard to be objectively critical about it, and all I can see is mistakes :)…still I feel it is an improvement on what was before. If you are using a PC computer and it looks bad, apologies for this, I have yet to check it on this platform, but will be getting to it over the next few days hopefully.

To go with this clean new look I have managed to have come up with a sound that has a cleanliness to it also. I can't say this was intentional, as I was really trying something else, but that is how it happens sometimes. It does have some similarities to Steinbrüchel I feel, and shares that kind of chime-like sound with the tones and with clinical clicks, although perhaps this one has a far harder edge to it.

Also apologies for not getting some good images up of late. What with being stuck at my desk for many days on end (not that I am complaining) I haven't been taking or searching for any photos or images. I have however stumbled across one today that I took a few weeks ago which considering what I have been up to, and wanting to share a little more of the studio, I felt was quite appropriate. This is the desk I am sat at almost all day everyday when I am not making sounds…I like it clean and tidy.

I hope you enjoy todays upload, and also find the new archives section and web design a slight improvement.
