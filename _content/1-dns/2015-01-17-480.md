Today's upload is experimenting some more with the Volca Sample and a little bit of software outboard, software that is holding place for its better hardware equivalent.

One great thing I have been reminded with the Volca Sample, much like any hardware sample sequencer, is being able to load up a track and hit play. Unlike some hardware sequencers which store tempo and all other settings, the Volca Sample has a little more freedom in that often a saved song although sounding familiar, yields all new textures and directionsâ€¦ all form simply hitting play.

A second Volca Sample is looking quite likely later this year, my only worry is everything else wont get used? Nah!

Enjoy
