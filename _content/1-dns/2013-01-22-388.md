Apologies for the delay in getting this post up, time is running on fast forward these days.

However, when the day runs past so quickly, it insists on being creative more efficiently. Normally the temptation in any kind of work is to continue to work it, and work it, until either it becomes tired and warn down, or it remains unfinished. 

What I am finding in having less time to 'do', means I actually spend 'more' time being productive. The necessity is in staying on top of things, finding better ways to do more and do it well. It results in a quite different way of working, and perhaps one that has more to do with addressing perspective, than reaching some preordained outcome.

A little test if you feel like trying it. Tomorrow, try spending less time on everything you do, and try to do it to the best of your ability considering that time. 
See how you get on.
