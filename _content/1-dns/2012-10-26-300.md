Some dubby delays and reverbs working with Nord clicks and pulse is the 300th and tonights upload.

This one works with effects right from the beginning, using them to create some subtle patterns and interesting textures within the rhythms.

I appreciate recently I have started using the occasional effect with the Nord, but I have again ensured there is a section with no effects used, in this case near the end.

I hope this one is enjoyable.

Thanks for all the support and listening once again, I appreciate it always.
