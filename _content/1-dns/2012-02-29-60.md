Todays upload is a variation on last Tuesday's sound, <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_52/" title="Snd 52">Snd 52</a>. This version is a darker, heavier sounding take, using different pitches and EQ. Although perhaps this version is not as interesting, I am quite liking the idea of blocks of sound, and thinking in particular to when these uploads might be listened back to as a collection. I like the idea of amongst the variation of complexity, rhythm and melodic sounds, there are the occasional mass of sound that seems to sit and appear resistant to move anywhere.

I am quite enjoying the reworking of previous sounds and might in-fact do this a great deal more than I have been. I am a big fan of replication, and comparing the similar. The battle with wanting to change or improve, against the concept or notion of wanting to stay the same or familiar, is a constant reward of contradiction and restriction that I have always found a joy and benefit.

I am enjoying comparing todays sound to last weeks, wondering what is thought of as the original. I like that even when the copy is considered the inferior, in so doing it further highlights the supremacy of its alternative and as a result could be considered as equally valuable and intrinsic to the evaluation as a whole.

Today I think I prefer last weeks sound, but perhaps tomorrow this could change, and I like the idea that it might. :)
