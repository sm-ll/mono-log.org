A challenging last few days as I grapple with organising my time, money and my mind to ensure the label Sm-ll happens when and how I want it to. Things are looking good.

After many days of uncertainty surrounding the many aspects that a record label and life demands, I am very confident and focused once again, with a clear structure to take me through until the rest of the year. Today I feel pretty refreshed, and I think todays upload reflects that.

I am very excited at how the shape and sound of Sm-ll is already taking its early form, with excitement being always challenged with what needs to be done to make this work how I want it to.

The greatest part of it all is how my perspective is forever challenged, insisting I become a better person, with better structure and management in my life, that I have better business skills and greater focus. 

These are all things that have also been highlighted and improved through doing this blog, with the greatest gift of all being an amazing bunch of you following along with this journey.

I hope todays upload is something you enjoy, and that the events that follow occurring throughout this year, are ones you consider yourself a supporting contributor towards making it all happen.

Thanks for all your support.
