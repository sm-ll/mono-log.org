Today is a very special upload, and one I am listening to now for only the first time while writing this.

Upon asking my partner Lucia what I should do for todays upload, she replied very enthusiastically “can I do it?”
With a big smile on my face I quickly agreed.

I am very excited to share Lucia's take on the Nord Modular and it sound, and hope you find it equally enjoyable. I am perhaps a little bias, but I think it sounds incredible.

If you enjoyed Lucia's solo work A Broken Field IV, on the <a href="http://www.dragonseyerecordings.com/catalogue/de6010.html" title="Dragon's Eye Recordings free download compilation Iron" target="_blank">Dragon's Eye Recordings free download compilation Iron</a> available at the beginning of this year, then you are certainly in for a treat.

Todays file size is larger than normal, so apologies if you are experiencing slow streaming. Due to the extreme nature of the frequencies used, I had to export at 360 kbps mp3 format to keep the sound as close to the original as possible.

Todays photo was also taken by Lucia, during our trip back to London from Montreal.
