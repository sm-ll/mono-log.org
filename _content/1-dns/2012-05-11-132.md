Todays uploads is another taking further steps towards finding that balance of genre and an introduction of context and language that will start of the label Sm-ll, and introducing the conceptual 12" series.

I feel this is perhaps one example that is closest to many of things I am trying to get right, and am beginning to understand the sound to be something that has an inspiration  taken from the structure of certain Techno music, with additional dub connections. But also there is the shifting of sound, a repetition and reduction of sound usage that ultimately barely just holds this sort of sound together.

For me, this upload also raises a question of the correctness of levels and frequency balance within a track, and no sooner does it falls close to a certain genre it seems to want to insist an adjustment of levels and frequency, to balance it in such a way fit neatly into that genre. This is something I have always attempting to challenge, and certainly something both me and Lucia have explored in our <a href="http://www.dragonseyerecordings.com/catalogue/de5036.html" title="CDR release on Dragon's Eye Recordings." target="_blank">CDR release on Dragon's Eye Recordings.</a>

When I hear such sounds as this, I think of the scene in a club environment that play this, and wonder if at all such a culture could exist, or are we forever stuck to only subtle variations of the beginning of such a culture. For me, my biggest dislike, if I had to think of it this way, was the way the heavy bass of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-909" title="TR-909 drum machine" target="_blank">TR-909 drum machine</a>, very much dictated a development of sound and music that could only ever get stuck, until a point where other aspects of that genre might be explored and not emulated in other sound making tools. I would often ask myself the sorts of question that tackled the genre's core structure, such as why the kick drum needs to have to kick?, why couldn't it be used in a more metronomic fashion? 

I have always felt that at the beginning of Techno music, it seemingly attempted to explore experiment the potential of its future yet all the while finding its feet. For me this led to radically different takes on essentially the same genre. What I feel I often hear now is not something I would have believed at the time to be the future of such a genre, which I wonder is perhaps more the result of technology leading the sound, as apposed to a sound being found in technology. Such products as <a href="http://www.d16.pl/index.php?menu=246" title="Plastikclicks" target="_blank">Plastikclicks</a> is a good example of this, and very much the sort of product that might have been shunned back in the 90's is now <a href="http://www.d16.pl/index.php?menu=171" title="side by side with endorsed emulations of old technology." target="_blank">side by side with endorsed emulations of old technology.</a>

This reminds of hiphop music too, something that worked as beats, chords and rhymes, a stripping back to the bare essentials in delivery, and in my opinion when hiphop was at its best.

I feel when sound gets overshadowed by complex structure or even more sound, it ever so slightly moves away from its original form, which in itself is not such a bad thing, but what this seems to create is not so much a development 'of' that genre, but perhaps something perhaps more close another genre entirely.

I am quite intrigued to hear peoples views on todays upload, not so much if you like it or not, although that is obviously welcomed, but other thoughts that may occur when listening to it.

I hope you enjoy todays upload.
