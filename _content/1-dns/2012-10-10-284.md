Further exploration into the Inkel mixer while creating for tonights upload.

I thought to first begin with just the Nord Modular, then slowly tweak the high end and mid frequencies, slowly added a bit of delay. This way both Nord and the influence of the Inkel mixer can be heard easier.

This is essentially almost two identical patches in the Nord Modular, one having some further adjustments made to it, to build up the sound a little bit.

I hope you enjoy it.
