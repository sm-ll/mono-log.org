Each morning I wake up, I make myself a coffee and while enjoying it I perch myself on our window sill to look out on the nearby neighbourhood.

On Sundays in particular there is always a different feeling to the activities that occur, and although obviously it is generally a non working day for many, it differs to Saturday and other days of the week in that it seems sleepy in comparison.

Although I can't say the same for everyone, from my experience of Sundays there is a underling rule that somewhat governs what we do and how we act. An almost separate consideration for the Sunday comes into play, in that it can't or at least shouldn't be structured like any other day, and that we in fact make an exception when thinking for the Sunday.

I have even experienced a subtle displacement of time, of feeling of having the wrong day, to then only realise it is actually a Sunday, and not Saturday like I may have initially thought. When this happens I suddenly have to reboot, in order to consider my day in the light of how Sunday demands it.

On Sundays we often have different foods, different schedules, sometimes meet different people or sleep different times. We do laundry, organise our possessions go for walks or drive slowly through country lanes.

I wonder how much the Sunday feeling is one felt strongly in other countries, and if so how it differs to that of my experience of it in the UK.

Coming from a sleepy seaside town in Dorset, I wonder if the sleepy Sunday is more a attitude I have brought with me to London, and that perhaps the difference I experience is coming more from me than the seemingly sleepy streets in my neighbourhood.

As I look across out of my window again, I see someone else is also doing their laundry, their sheets hanging from their window to dry.
