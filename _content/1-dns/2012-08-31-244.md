Today has been a great day, and part of what made it great was<a href="http://www.factmag.com/2012/08/31/peter-van-hoesen-to-release-new-album-next-week-stream-it-here-now/" title=" listening to the new work of Peter Van Hosen" target="_blank"> listening to the new work of Peter Van Hosen</a>, and his approaching album Perceiver.

A combination of melodic textures and rhythmic motion that took me to a place I haven't been to in sometime with new music, with the exception of the collaboration work of Peter and Yves De May as Sendai, with their amazing album Geotope.

While this great day is ending and I began to create something for todays upload, I was reminded again of these two great releases, inspiring an edgy and dense sound into my own creation. And although my effort is far simpler by comparison, I only hope if it is enjoyable, that I might prompt you to seek out these two albums Geotope and Perceiver, and add them to your collection, as they are both remarkable works.
