So we have reached upload Snd 200, amazing. Thank you all for your support its been amazing, I can't thank you all enough.

To celebrate this 200 mark I wanted to pay homage to a good friend of mine Mike Oliver, who was firstly an inspiration, not only through his music but through his incredible vision and contribution to the world of music in general and my world specifically. This creation was called Smallfish, a London based music shop…yes a real one.

Smallfish and Mike in particular, was the first to introduce me to <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Komet" title="Komet" target="_blank">Komet</a>, a recommendation during my love of the label <a href="http://www.scape-music.de/" title="~scape" target="_blank">~scape</a>, were responsible for my finding the work of <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Motion+(2)" title="Motion" target="_blank">Motion</a> and introducing his other project <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Recon" title="Recon" target="_blank">Recon</a>, another huge influence on my sound. Also the shop I bought <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Stephan-Mathieu-Full-Swing-Edits/release/155205" title="Full Swing Edits" target="_blank">Full Swing Edits</a> a release I am always mentioning on this blog, and buying my first from other great labels such as <a href="http://www.12k.com/" title="12k" target="_blank">12k</a> and <a href="http://www.lineimprint.com/" title="Line" target="_blank">Line</a>, one of the few to stock this great music here in the UK, and I believe sole stockists in London.

Smallfish was also a main reason for my moving from my home town to Winchester, and half way point in my efforts to get to London. Although it was this move to Winchester, and my travelling up to London that first day in my new city. that I was to learn Smallfish was no longer operating as a physical shop and was reluctantly closed to run purely online. This would essentially the beginning of Smallfish's upsetting decline until its eventual complete closure a few years later.

It was many years later that I would meet Mike again, through friends Yann Novak and France Jobin, who were kind to introduce us formally, and this would begin in my mind a passion of mind to bring back what Smallfish was so influential to me, to in turn create something that would influence others.

It is this story that is the foundation of what stands as the beginning of my record label Sm-ll, both a homage and beginning for doing what Smallfish done for me.

I have a mission, to make Sm-ll great enough that I can have Mike involved, to be a part, to give back to him something that he lost and to aim to turn the page to a new chapter. I am determined to make something great happen so I can help him and others like me, me the young influential sponge soaking up what Smallfish had to offer.

Mike and me have become friends over the recent years and have talked about working on something together for the near future, a combination of his gorgeous clean dub-techno sound that is <a href="http://www.remote-underscore.co.uk/releaseshigh.htm" title="Remote_" target="_blank">Remote_</a> and my more textured and shifting sound of Pokk!…obviously I am very excited.

I thought today I would use <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP6QOyVR2H4&feature=plcp" title="Solitude Part II" target="_blank">Solitude Part II</a> as a basis for todays upload, creating a faster paced chord swirling sketch that I hope encourages you all to check out the original.

Rumor has it that Mike is itchy once again to create after his quite long break from working on music. I can't wait.

I hope you enjoy this sketch and upload, and please do listen to other works from <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Remote_" title="Remote_" target="_blank">Remote_</a> and his various aliases.

Enjoy.
