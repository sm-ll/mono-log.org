Recently I have been talking with my partner about how context, agencies of that context and social conditioning are often enforcers in the definition of genre, taste, style and various other similar subjective notions that make up the world and those in it. In considering this along side such things as multiples, repetition, familiarity, expectation, investment, identification, belonging and the numerous other reasons we might find satisfaction in something, I wonder if such elements in part, could be used in creation and the general creative process specifically?

The understanding of ‘creation’ at least found from an initial external glance in, seems to vary in quite key ways across the various creative outlets that we have all defined as such. For example Architecture, the design and creation of functional structure, how it can influence and shape our world is always in conversation with its inhabitants as an integral component to its very existence. Building is shaped around and for the scale of human, and if that fundamental is removed, arguably it is no longer defined as such. 

Graphic Design and perhaps more specifically Typography, also seems in direct connection in regards of the communication and the practicalities essential of that to support it. The understanding and importance of positive and negative space, position, scale, vertical flow and the various other methods applied, in delivering something that well…just seems to work.

I wonder if when removing certain elements, the functionality of a building for example, or perhaps the legibility of a text, where these fall in regards of being understood in their initial context? ‘Experimental’ is perhaps one term that is used to place these uncertainties in a nice metaphorical labelled box. The problem with experimental, is there seems a blurring of defining what can simply be thought of as good or bad experimental. The range is vast, the language is complex and the context is so varied that an understanding to be experienced of that found beyond simply ‘experimental’ is rather tricky to achieve. To go back to the two examples before, a building that falls down, or a text that cannot be read is pretty unanimously thought of as failing, yet the same clarity is difficult to find when considering a experimental performance of a man kissing a guitar then blowing a duck whistle against another seemingly doing almost nothing behind their laptop. At the very least is seems most certainly a tricky defining situation.
