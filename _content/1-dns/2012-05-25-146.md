Tonights upload was created with something in mind that I generally haven't thought about all that much over the years, and that would be the feeling of Friday night.

While reading some interviews today I noticed how often it seems musicians create more around feelings than thoughts of the mind, and although I obviously do that too, I find generally speaking my mind is more the leading role when I create, than what I feel. 

When listening back to <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_145/" title="yesterdays upload" target="_blank">yesterdays upload</a>, perhaps the most emotional sounding upload so far, I wasn't aware consciously of my emotions, but perhaps yesterday was telling sign that I am only coming to realise today.

My experiences of listening to music over the years have been generally the most enjoyable when being challenged mentally, more than moved emotionally. Obviously emotions are always at play, but perhaps it is when those emotions that are less easily definable, that in turn lend themselves more to thought.

Tonight, I felt like it was Friday, perhaps it was the noise and activity that is always noticeable where I live, or perhaps it was because I am exhausted and only the emotions are able to linger on, or perhaps it is something else.

Whatever it is, I hope you enjoy Friday nights upload.
