Experiments with simple forms is the theme for tonights upload.

The more I have been experimenting with rhythmical sounds, the more I have been enjoying the spaces between them, the subtleties in sound or of the gap informing the feel and pace of the groove.

I feel, for me, this sort of pattern lends itself well to exploring more abstract sound. There is less a sense of sounds working with each other in the sense of them being layered, but more in a kind of alternating fashion, a punctuation of each sound.
A hot and sticky night here in London has perhaps contributed to the sounds being scruffy, and because of this I am once again keen to hear them in tomorrow more cooler morning air, to compare.

Often there is a temptation to change the sounds to fit our taste, but I often wonder, that if this is the point at which we settle, convinced of sound track or idea, then our taste or style cannot perhaps progress in certain ways.

I am quite enjoying the last few days and not feeling completely convinced of each upload, and looking forward to some periods of reflection and seeing how things sound and what that might do for the next time I sit down and create something.

I hope for tonight at least it is an enjoyable listen.
