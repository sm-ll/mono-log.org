Today I woke up early after a dream prompting me to think some more about some ideas I have had for many years in repetitive structures within sound and music.

Specifically this thinking uses what perhaps falls neatly into the Techno genre, but really doesn't use nearly as many of the structures or language found in Techno, and is more akin to the work of Steve Reich than any Techno artist. Ironically, or probably more obviously, I was inadvertently exposed to Steve Reich's work and this experimenting with shifting structures via a Techno band called Orbital, who were inspired and referencing Steve Reich. As is always the case in most music, its always good to know the history as almost always there is more to learn or sometimes even better examples to be found.

After I woke up, and after the slight distraction by re-watching some Kraftwerk documentaries/videos online, I sat and made a hierarchy list that went something like this:

– Volume
– Frequency
– Stereo Position
– Pattern Position
– Musical/Cultural Influence
– Expectation In Pattern (eg 1, 2, 3, ?)

The main purpose of writing this out was really to embed these thoughts into my mind a little more, ideas that up until now have just been either floating about in my head or found in part on certain tracks I or others might have made. I thought I would share them here, just to maybe provide some light on my unprepared writing here on this blog.

The basic idea is finding a balance of both a good track that references established genres, but also uses the structures within that genre as the points in which to play with those structures, folding them, moving them, shifting them to sit somewhere between their origins and slightly not, forever moving to another. The bass drum that becomes the hat, passing over their lead to one another.

A example of where I first thought about these ideas is found in Plastikman's track <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOrTm3QWtn8" title="Hypokondriak" target="_blank">Hypokondriak</a>, probably my favourite of all his work. Through the shifting frequency of what sits neither as a Bass Drum or Tom, and yet is both, comes a play on the Techno structure, admittedly a rather subtle one, but it doesn't quite follow the typical rules of the kick being the solid bass sound that we expect from Techno. Interestingly we <i>do</i> expect this sort of sound as Plastikman, which is partly the reason I like his work so much, or at least everything up to and including the album Artifakts where this track is found.

Another reason is this track is allowed to basically alter its structure slightly through the frequency shifts allowing the track to it pretty sit as it did at the beginning. It finds a combination of sound and structure that works together in a way that almost insists a certain outcome to work as it does. Much like Steve Reich music just wouldn't be the same with no shifting of patterns.

Hypokondriak is an example that really only shows a small part of my thoughts, with Steve Reich's music showing another, and by combining these along with those others in the list, an outcome of satisfying structural shifting seems to need very specific sounds. With this way of thinking, both the structure and sound are hugely insistant on each other.

I appreciate this probably doesn't make any sense at all, and nor should it really, not unless I write a lot more. However, I feel of all the amazing things words can do, and there are many, sound can do many things that words simply cannot. So I think its probably best just to listen to todays upload, and perhaps I will write more about this another time.

I hope you enjoy todays sound.
