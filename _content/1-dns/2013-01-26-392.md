Today has been 606 day, probably in preparation for the TB-303 that will arrive tomorrow. Very much looking forward to that.

For todays upload is a quick dubby sketch using the Roland TR-606 running into the Nord audio input, something I haven't done in a while and have never done on this blog with external machines.

Not much to say, hope you enjoy the upload.
