Today has been a great day, and its days like these that I wish could be everyday, sadly this is never the case, although saying that I am going to try hard to remember what made this day so great and attempt to find it again.

Why is today so good you might be wondering?

Well, firstly I awoke having had probably only 6 hours sleep, and normally I would feel terrible but today there seem to be something inside that was insisting I worked on those things I always never get around to. Perhaps this day started well after geting the many little things out the way recently that have been on my mind, and as they say, the weight has been lifted.

Another reason today was good, I didn't feel the need to eat as much as I have in the past few years, a small thing but something that has always bothered me, and because of this, when I did eat I felt great and enjoyed it tremendously. I have had more energy today than I would normally, and always found that little extra to do the things I wanted.

Another reason today was great, is I moved a few things around in the studio and cleaned and hovered everything. This is something I thing I like to do and have not be able to in a long while, obviously I clean, but not the tidying or more specifically the organising and experimenting with placement within space, something I have always done since a child and seemingly neglected as I grew older, not feeling it was important. Clearly I was wrong.

It seems strange to think that something as simple as this would have such an influence on me, but there it is. I have found that the niggle inside of me, the knot I have felt for years, is slowly undoingâ€¦amazing, all it took was a bit of organising.

For todays upload, I did two, well actually there was about four points I considered recording but decided to refine it and refine it before hitting record. I am only going to upload the second one, a slightly more moody and gritty sounding pattern and I have picked this one as it is probably the most diverse sounding of all the uploads, and something I think is important in these sorts of matters.

I hope you enjoy it, and have a great weekend yourself.
