One man whose music never ceases to amaze me and is also someone who I rarely mention on this blog and yet is a firm favourite in our home, is Stefan Betke aka <a href="http://pole-music.com/" title="pole">pole</a>.

I have been a fan and inspired by his sounds ever since his incredible album Pole 1. Afterwards through his label Scape~ he brought such great artists to my ears such as Jan Jelinek, Kit Clayton, Andrew Pekler, Burnt Freidman and many others.

TodayI have been listening the amazing work Pole, and as a result find myself creating something with his sound in mind, although clearly my own direction.

As before, I have decided on adding some of the effects to the Nord but also presenting it dry in some places. Personally I really like the comparison of the Wet Dry balance of sound and effects.

I hope you enjoy this one.
