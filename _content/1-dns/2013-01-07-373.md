So today I am starting my new job, and with a new job comes a new routine. As with all routines that begin, there is a little adjustment here and there until settling into it.

One desire of this routine for me is being able to write something for Mono-log before I travel into work. I have to start work between 9-10AM on the other side of London, a little over an hour travel, so its an early start for me, which is nice.

While showering and thinking of what to write this morning, showing and thinking probably being two most complimentary combinations, I experienced something that reminded me of how important perspective is in our life, and how this perspective can easily rule our own decisions, decisions that pave the way for our future.

Our shower room is a small room with no windows and so no real indication of the outside world and its activities. While I already understood it was still dark outside, I attempted to imagine it was actually daylight, and perhaps the middle of the day.

With the exception of the sounds coming from the shower, it was extremely quiet, not something my building is particularly good at. As much as I tried to image it was later in the day it simply sounded early in the morning, and try as I might, I just couldn't imagine it was daylight outside.

This reminded me slightly of the famous thought experiment of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat" title="Schrödinger's cat">Schrödinger's cat</a>.

Similar experiences I can think of would be when watching a film at a cinema, and then leaving the darkness being surprised by either the brightness or darkness. The interesting part of this is that both possibilities are a surprise, with the exception of perhaps being in dark before entering the cinema, to then emerge in dark once again.

The reason I am thinking this on today of all days, is that through our experience we begin to understand a situation, but also projected experience shapes a possible future. 

It is this that makes me wonder if it is partly the reason that changing the status quo is often so hard to do. One would think we could just simply, well un-think it.
