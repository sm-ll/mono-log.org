Today I awoke to a wonderfully clean studio, the sky in London is blue (which is rare) and while sipping my first coffee of the morning I found out that <a href="http://www.troncolon.com/" title="Sawako" target="_blank">Sawako</a>, one of my favourite and influential artists all time, has bought herself a Nord Modular.

I have met online a few people who have bought Nord Modulars partly from following this blog, and this is really amazing, and such a wonderful feeling when something that I do allows me to meet others and even inspires them to buy this great synth. However, I believe Sawako has bought this entirely unconnected to this blog, and so is purely coincidental, this is truly amazing.

I have followed Sawakos work pretty much from the beginning, and first heard her sounds through an online release with the incredible label <a href="http://www.stasisfield.com/artists/sawako.html" title="Stasisfield" target="_blank">Stasisfield</a>, and other early releases on aesova and tuMp3, some of which you can buy again at her <a href="http://sawako.bandcamp.com/" title="Bandcamp page." target="_blank">Bandcamp page.</a>. It is well worth listening to all her work as it's all amazing in my view, and many of my friends have found an enjoyment of Sawako's sounds too, and even those who are less interested in electronic music in general, are able to connect.

For todays upload, I first listened to Sawako's Yours Gray album, a personal favourite of mine, and was intending on paying a homage to Sawako's sounds, however, as is often the case when using the Nord Modular, things sometimes go where they want to, as I imagine Sawako might well find out when using her own Nord Modular. 

As a result, I have created something that it perhaps more in line with the clicks and pops found in more <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jan+Jelinek" title="Jan Jelinek's">Jan Jelinek's</a> work perhaps, although a very different sound, but a sound that is still familiar, and one that reminds me quite a bit of the mood and textures found in a recent album I bought my <a href="http://poryahatami.bandcamp.com/album/land" title="Porya Hatami entitled Land, another release I recommend checking out." target="_blank">Porya Hatami entitled Land, another release I recommend checking out.</a>

Well, I hope you enjoy todays upload and enjoy the recommendations, have a great Sunday.
