After a worrying gap caused by some problems, the <a href="http://www.12k.com/forum/index.php" title="12k forum">12k forum</a> is back online and with all the posts still intact, great news.

The 12k forum has been a place where I have met some wonderful people who have, and still are, supporting this blog.

Considering its return, this took me back to some older uploads I had done earlier this year, and so I thought I would create something textured, tone based and hopefully relaxing to the ear.

I also learned some new techniques to get some nice crackle textures, and spent a bit of time hopefully getting a reasonable balance of sound, although as always there is only so much I can do in a handful of hours

This upload is 4 patches, or rather 2 pairs each slightly tweaked. I think I have only used 4 patches a few other times this whole year. 

Also, I should add, this upload begins with the Space Echo and MXR Phase 90 only, I then fade in the dry signal from the Nord, which you will hear on its own at the endâ€¦oh and this upload is a bit long :)

Anyway, I wanted to say thanks for your constant inspiration 12k, and for the support from all the people at the 12k forum.

Enjoy.
