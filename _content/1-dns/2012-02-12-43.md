Sorry for the slight delay in getting todays sound up. It has been a disruptive day, with sounds that I feel reflect it.

The day began with a gang related shooting outside our building in the early hours of the morning, with three shot and a fourth with head injuries. Later that morning the arrival of the many ilegal churches that use many of the empty buildings in our road, could not reach their normal place of worship and in the case of one group decided to have their service on the road side instead. I was torn between the experience of something that sounded quite beautiful, unique and rare, and yet that equally highlighted questions of our society and how it is or isn't allowed to function. I was both disrupted by this church service, and in some ways annoyed that is was allowed to continue, and yet incredibly grateful to be experiencing it.

I think this start to the day, has put me on edge, and I was unable to think about anything with much clarity. After many attempts at todays upload, I have settled on this. A rough and edgy disruption of sound that shares as much wrong with it, as it does right. I think ultimately it is a question of balance, and feel todays events were a strong demonstration to that.
