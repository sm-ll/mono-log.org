Todays upload is a revised version of a sketch me and Lucia created on the Akai S2800. 

Originally it was using an old record full of different tones and sound phenomena as its source, recording each sound into the Akai using it much like a loop pedal. 

I remember this time being an incredible moment we shared with us both using equipment at the same time to create, something quite different to how we normally work, that being generally quite separate.

When I listen to this sound, there is more that comes to mind than fond memories of this time we shared, I also remember being amazed at how the Akai had seemingly become a different tool in the time since I used it properly last. Previously I would have been using it to create more rhythmical experimental and abstract electronic music or Techno in the 90's. Since that time much has changed both musically and creatively. I relate to sound differently and as a result create differently also. 

Working together with Lucia opened the Akai to a new and exciting world of sound creation, and what had been maintained in my mind as an old machine embedded with a particular sound, like the smell of someones home finding its way onto their clothes, had be changed and replaced with a new association, had fallen into a new context. Now when I look at the Akai sampler, I am eager to use it again, to find out what it can now do that it seemed unable to before.

For me, this is at least one good reason why a world that exists solely online, is only half a world.

Object are essential to our life, and I feel that perhaps one of the greatest achievements from the internet, is how it is teaching us the value and importance of something physical, of something real, something we can touch and can smell, and look at a second time and make a new connection. Through a period of almost losing our way in understanding the importance of objects, a period of wanting or 'having' to replace everything with an online version, we are finding that a virtual version is just that, a 'version', that can only and should only be considered an option, and not a replacement.
