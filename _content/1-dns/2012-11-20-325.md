Very strange sounds and grooves for tonights upload.

An eerie spluttering of mangled 606 like sounds, along with unstable and unpredictable effects. I think this one gets easier as it goes in, as it also took me some time to find my way in to this groove.

I'd be interested to know what people think of this one, and especially if there are some of you out there who often find themselves creating something a little odd that normally stays hidden within the studio archives.

I feel like I need to back up creatively before I totally get lostâ€¦haha. Still, it is where I am this evening, so I am happy to share it with you all.

Enjoy :)
