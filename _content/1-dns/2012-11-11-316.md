Recently me nd my partner have been looking at various bits of equipment, and one that has caught our eye, or ear, is the phasor.

In particular the beautiful but pricey Mu-Tron Bi-Phase, or the cute minimal styled and cheap MXR Phase-90.

I have not been a fan of pedals, mainly because of their design with crazy graphics, but also the way they are used, the clunky foot switch. We have a few pedals, and I can't say I enjoy using them, which is a shame as they are really portable and often sound incredible.

The MXR pedals however are very nice looking, and I could be convinced to give these a try, and the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase is so big, it doesn't really look much like a pedal and more like a desktop module, with the control panel separate to the foot switch. Again I could be tempted.

So for todays upload I started experimenting with creating a phase effect in the Nord Modular, before moving it into a surreal phasing chord type sound. Sometimes when creating something it just wants to go where it wants to.

It begins with just the Nord G1, before fading in some effects for the Space Echo and Inkel, then returning back to the Nord only once again.

I hope you enjoy it.
