Today's upload is a result of beginning to explore Synchronous Granular Synthesis, or SGS within the Nord Modular. 
I have tried at reaching such a result before, but have always failed.

Today's effort was looking much like the same issue again, until I remembered the Granular Patch I created in MAX/MSP many years ago, modelled on Nobaysu Sakonda's version.

Ultimately this uses the Phase of each tone generator to trigger the next in line of envelopes. Each phase being set to a slight delay to that before it, they each create the overlapping of tones that I was after. 

I must say for the short time I spent on it this morning I am quite happy and excited about developing it further.

The sound itself is loosely inspired by the recent album I bought on the incredible <a href="http://www.matter.jp/works/releases/works-list.html" title="mAtter label, by owner and artist Yukitomo Hamasaki and his album d+p.">mAtter label, by owner and artist Yukitomo Hamasaki and his album d+p.</a> The image is also inspired by this album, one I highly recommend getting while they still have some left.
