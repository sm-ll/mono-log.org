So recently I have been watching various videos on the new Korg Volca Sample, and quite impressed I have to say. For £119, it's a great little box, perfect for mobile use. I first spotted it on Andreas Tilliander's Repeatle youtube page and highly recommend looking that up…and, as you do when looking through youtube, and specifcally Andrea's page, silver boxes, e-bay and lots of google searching as we spin out of control in equipment bliss. 

That boy has too many machines :)

One thing I like about Andreas's channel and many others for that matter, is being able to see vaious machines doing their thing. It reminds me of one of my first encounters with studio gear at a friends house back when I was a wee lad. Walking into his room and seeing each box doing it's part to make up a whole was incredible, and I knew there and then, I want this.

I don't think much has changed in all these years. I seem to either like using one box completey on it's own, or using multiple boxes but keeping each to a sepcific role. For me, having too much going on in any way, starts to insist I think more about things, and I am finding more and more, actively trying to think less is sometimes a very good thing, well, at least when making music. There is certainly a moment I recognise when creating, and specifically for these uploads, is that moment when nothing much is happening, I can feel my head is full of thoughts, and yet when things start to work, those thoughts seems to just move to the back of the mind to be replaced with more instinctive decisions.

In classic Andreas fashion, today's upload is silver box based, although probably less boxes and less notes.
