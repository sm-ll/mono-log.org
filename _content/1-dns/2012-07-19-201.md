Some more texture based tones for this upload, I can't get enough of this sound recently. This one in particular takes me back to a track I created using the PC based software <a href="http://hem.passagen.se/rasmuse/Granny.htm" title="Granulab" target="_blank">Granulab</a>, back in 2000. I remember it getting picked for an online radio, the email I received to ask permission saying they couldn't find much other music like this. I would have to say some 12 years later, I would still say it is quite rare to hear this sort of sound, and I am not sure why.

I have always enjoyed how melodic suggestions are embedded in repetitive textures, and how through the slow fading from one texture part to another can completely change the mood. I have focused a little more on this area of fading texture with todays upload.

Enjoy.
