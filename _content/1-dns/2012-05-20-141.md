Some experimentation with pattern and texture for todays upload, resulting in a slightly irritable sound but having some interesting moments as it shifts around.

I can't say this is the result I was looking for this morning, or really like as something to listen to as it, but was thinking about my upload a little differently today and so decided to go with it, seeing where this mindset would put me and what kind of interesting things might happen.

It does sound a great deal like a very old patch I did some years ago, back not long after buying the Nord Modular, and kind of feel that perhaps this slightly more laid back approach does lead me more to sounds that are less organised, structured and more random and certainly sounding more like a sound than sketch. 

This is approach is certainly something to consider for the future, should I want to create some interesting sounds more than track idea, then this might be a preferred way to approach the Nord Modular. This is certainly the sort of sound I might well sample sections of, as apposed to whole sections.

Enjoy your Sunday.
