Muffled through a wall, heard, seen as imagined on this side. Gaps, erratic movement, banging, thumping. An invisible projection of your world on my wall. This life sounds of terror,  its direction challenged by thin plaster and the simple indecision to change.

One place changed by another. Domestic A altering domestic B. I am listening to you, are you listening to yourself?
