Some interesting bubbles sounds filtering in tonights upload, in what was partially a accidental delay effect.

Using the Sawtooth waveform I sometimes use very low frequencies to create a sort of clicking pattern, but here today it took on much more of a delay like quality, which is pretty exciting. I think I will look into this a little further and see what else I can do with it for future uploads.

Tonight upload is consisting of 4 patches in total. All of which are modified from previous experiments in creating sounds inspired by the Roland TB303 and TR606.

Quite a nice surprise during the creation of this one, and one I hope you will enjoy.
