A late upload tonight but an exciting one. This upload is created with my good long term friend Adam Baker, owner of labels <a href="http://www.dirtydemos.co.uk/" title="Dirty Demos" target="_blank">Dirty Demos</a> and <a href="http://ampsagainsttrend.tumblr.com/" title="Amps Against Trend" target="_blank">Amps Against Trend</a>, and also behind the output of <a href="http://blotchcreek.blogspot.co.uk/" title="Dead Wood," target="_blank">Dead Wood,</a> do check this work out.

A short post as it is a night of chatting, catching up and drinking Sherry Cask Whiskey. :)

Enjoy our collaborative sounds.
