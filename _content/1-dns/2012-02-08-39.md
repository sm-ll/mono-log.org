The past few weeks there have been road constructions outside our studio, and for the most part it has been quiet enough while I work on some Nord sounds in the morning, although today that changed. 

What with road cutting power tools and our thin studio windows, and also due to me listening to <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/artists/antti_rannisto/" title="Anti Rannisto">Anti Rannisto</a> quite a bit again, it is no wonder that today's upload sounds more dense.

More ironically, as I sit here now typing in this entry, having finished the Nord sound, the road works have obviously stopped, typical. But something a little unexpected has happened, the sound I created that I am listening to now, has become very calm all of a sudden. 

It really does go to show how much external sounds influence us, not only in the way we feel, but also in how we hear and understand other sounds too.
