Firstly, sorry again for the lateness of this upload. Myself and Lucia had a performance tonight which has delayed this upload a little. 
Our performance although very different to our normal sound, went ok we feel. It was the first for us both using some of our new equipment, my TR606 and Lucia's MFB were among them.

Following on from our performance being one of a more analogue set up, I felt a more typical analogue synth sound would be nice.

I think this upload sits somewhere between some previous uploads and also a classic analogue hint.

I hope you enjoy it.
