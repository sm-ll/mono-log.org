Number 80!â€¦wow doesn't time fly.

Todays upload I must say I am enjoying myself quite a bit here and owe a huge amount of inspiration to my spending some time this morning listening to mine and Lucia's favourite <a href="http://www.matter.jp/" title="mAtter">mAtter</a> release of Yukitomo Hamasaki, entitled d+p. I have <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_41/" title="mentioned this release before" target="_blank">mentioned this release before</a> on this blog, and again highly recommend looking up <a href="http://www.matter.jp/" title="mAtter">mAtter</a> if you haven't already done so.

Another first and exciting part of todays upload for me, is its use of the algorithmic logic modules in the Nord Modular. Essentially these can decide where and when to send information which can be used to shape the sound in less predictable ways than say more simple to use LFO's. This is not to say predictability is a bad thing, for this is something I actually prefer in most cases, but perhaps due to my general dislike of overly obvious algorithmic composition, I have yet to really use the Logic modules within the Nord Modular. I must say I am pretty pleased I have finally dug into them, and recommend doing so for anyone who uses a Nord Modular.

As always I hope you enjoy todays upload, and feel free to email me or contact me at the ways mentioned on this blog.

Thanks for listening and reading, I am looking forward to tomorrow already.
