More experimentation with noise and tones with this upload, although this time attempting something a little different and a little less orderly than previous uploads.

Snd 170 has a rough and edgy quality to it, reminding me of some of the more radical sound creations of <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Kit+Clayton" title="Kit Clayton."  target="_blank">Kit Clayton, </a> his work certainly being an influence on me.

I think this sound has much in common also with vinyl record experiments, with it having the occasional sound scurry of texture and crackling of activity. This is quite interesting and perhaps worth looking into in the future for future uploads.

The initial interest in the creation of tonight upload, was in creating a more reverberate quality to the sound, balancing more focused foreground sound with more spacious and distributed background sounds. Although I didn't image it would sound like this, I can hear this happening. I haven't been a big fan of using reverb for a long time, although I don't mind it being used so much, I find when I use it, it covers up much of the work I put in, and ultimately much prefer putting this quality of sound into the dry sound itself in a way a why reverb might be used. I feel this way this reverb quality becomes more texture and is heard more as sound than effect.

I hope you enjoy tonights effort.
