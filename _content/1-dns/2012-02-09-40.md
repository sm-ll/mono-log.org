As a fan of repetition and frameworks or systems in music and life in general, I have recently become quite interested by the idea of replication as a creative process.

Generally when we think of replication, or copying, there tends to be a feeling of the one being inferior to the other. Notice I don't say the original and the copy thought unanimously as one being better than the other. Often we have experienced somebody excited about some new song, only when to be played it, we are traumatised by this horrible modernised and butchered rehash of a classic tune. What adds to the frustration is when playing this person 'the original' they don't share our enthusiasm for what we consider 'the better version', the original.

I am not talking so much about this sort of situation of preference, as this only occurs when we have access or experience of another version to compare to. I am more thinking, as I mentioned earlier, replication when used in the creative process alone. 

Normally there is a tendency to consider the output or context of the work onces its finished while creating it, and for me this, often gets in the way of the actual creation side of things. As a thought I wonder through changing the creation process to something more abstract and manual, akin to painting a wall, that this issue can be sidestepped.

Normally when thinking about 'doing something again' in the creative process, we do so to improve on the last, modify or explore new directions, but not to attempt an exact replica. Ultimately to attempt to copy something exactly, results in failure, which I feel is a key aspect to this notion of replication in the creative process. It is not to so much succeed in replication, but more a result of 'by how little can I fail'.

I have been talking over this idea with a few people recently, and as a result of talking with my partner, she suggested I attempt at replicating something from her new split release with <a href="http://www.weeld.net/colourofquantum.html" title="Yuki Aida on Murmur Records, called Colour of Quantum.">Yuki Aida on Murmur Records, called Colour of Quantum.</a>

I have decided on a small section form the beginning of the cd, the track called 'G'. This track is very complex to what initially seems a simple tone, but was made through a reduction process of White Noise. As I am using the Nord Modular, I am working in an opposite fashion to Lucia's work. I am having to work from the bottom up, building of tones through modulation, Lucia on the other hand working for the top down, stripping back frequencies through elaborate processing.

So today's upload comes close to the original 'G', but ultimately is it's own beast. Through a level of accepted failure, I feel an interesting result has occurred.

I certainly think this creative process opens scope for collaborative work, and is very fitting to the present day, what with file sharing, and access to so much music so quickly and easily.
