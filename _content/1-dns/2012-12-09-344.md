This is my second sitting at creating tonights upload, and after a period of not feeling quite happy the first time and then returning after a break, I have created something that has just enough groove and sound to hold it all together, and with my tired ears and eyes it seems ok.

This slight difficulty with todays upload reminded me of an email I received recently asking me about my creative process. I haven't really written about this in much detail and what I have mentioned is scattered about in the various posts. 

So over the coming days I will write something explaining a little more about how I do things, why I do them. I imagine there will be a little bit of technical stuff, but generally technical stuff doesn't interest me all that much. I need it, so I learn it, but other things affect me more.

Anyway, more on that later, for now its late, and so I will leave this post here.

Enjoy the clonky rhythms.
