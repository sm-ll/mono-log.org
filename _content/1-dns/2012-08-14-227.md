For tonights upload I have decided on making something with warm chord changes that perhaps are Jelinek-esque. This is after listening to the amazing album <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Gramm" title="Personal Rock, from 1999.">Personal Rock, today at work.</a>

I think again for me, this is yet another case of earlier work being my preferred of all. I have often mentioned when enjoying the work from the artists I admire, it is their earliest work that grabs my attention the most. There is often something simplistic and raw about much of it, perhaps before they are able to get their sound as they want it, or maybe this was the point where their sound was at its best, never to be repeated again, who knows.

It is clearly a subjective thing, but in most case it is this raw simplicity that I enjoy.

I often get a little uncomfortable with the definition minimal. One persons minimal is another symphony. I kind of feel such point of defining could be easier understood as merely sounding or not, and that which falls in between. Personally, I like less things that attempt to be minimal, or maximal for that matter, but more the way these two extremes might work together.

Tonights upload is perhaps also a balancing of the more constant and full chord, alongside the sparse sounds of previous rhythmic uploads. Although the rhythm here has similar sounds, very similar, it is really more a collection of sounds creating a beat in the obvious sense. Previous uploads attempt to find gaps, experiment with sounding or not, with the notion of beats less a considerationâ€¦at least I hope this is case.

I think after what can be considered many sparse uploads, todays is a nod towards slightly warmer and hopefully bringing a sense or preference away from what could have easily been considered 'minimal', into something perceived as a little more.

Regardless of how I might ponder something, ultimately I hope you can enjoy it however that might be.
