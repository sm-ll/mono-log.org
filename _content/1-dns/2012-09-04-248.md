Obviously I am very honoured to be the one to begin the new label SonuoS, and to be supported by such great people, which is what it is all about.

For tonights upload I thought I would push through my very tired mind and body, and create something of a thank you to Mokira for his wonderful remix, and a special thank you to Finn for being the great person he is.

I hope you can enjoy listen to this hissy, clicking bass heavy spluttering, and while listening maybe take a moment to remember those people who may have helped you out at some point. :)

Thank you.
