An upload somewhere between Techno and Dubâ€¦and something else? was maybe the direction for this upload I created earlier today, although now listening back tonight while I upload it things sound very different indeed.

Hmmm, listening as I write and trying to make sense of a previous vibe and now this new listening perspectives. Yeah not sure what to think of this actually. Its kind of busy, but fun sounding.

I think much of my uncertainty i writing and listening to my upload comes after experiencing this evenings incredible bass sounds and washes from the <a href="http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?421264" title="installation">installation</a> by the amazing artists<a href="http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/emptyset" title="Emptyset">Emptyset</a>. Its the first time that I have experienced hints of Techno or at least what reminded me of club culture, that has seeped into an art context, and I have to say a welcoming influence.

I am still digesting Emptyset's sounds, and so don't want to say something now, but I did enjoy it.

Obviously as I am finding it difficult to say much about my upload, I will just say I hope you enjoy that too.
