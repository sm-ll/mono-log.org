Days and evenings alone, with only sounds to keep me company.

It dawned on me again today how little I actually listen to music throughout the day like I used to as a youngster. Before now I would be forever surrounded in sounds, from the moment I woke up till the last few moments before I slept, and sometimes beyond.

Today my studio was filled with sounds.

I wonder why it has become decided additional sounds are less in my environment, and I can only presume it is through no longer living alone, although I am not really sure this is the case. Thinking again, I wonder if it is really that the sounds that are added are supported by someone else, their movements changing how I hear these sounds, or perhaps it is my knowledge of the sounds in the room are not mine alone.

Today has been filled with sounds from years past, sounds that again amaze me, and whose authors demonstrate again their incredible originality and vision. 

As the music of now often seems more and more generic to my ears, I hope to hear sounds like these again, sounds that can remind me of how long they have been gone.

I hope you enjoy todays sound.
