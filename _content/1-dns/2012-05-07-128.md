A holiday or break away is often a time where we can relax, perhaps paint the fence, tidy the shelves etc, but it is also a time for me where I like to take a deep breath and find a new bout of enthusiasm that I can hopefully maintain a little longer.

Today had me waking up much earlier than I have been of late, and eager to get stuck into some work, but more importantly than just working, I wanted to find a calm inside me that allowed me to work in a freer way.

I often find the motivation or the mood behind something has a huge influence on what I do, how I do it, and how I generally feel about matter surrounding it. When creating todays upload I tried to position myself in a fram of mind that allowed me the space I needed to breath, to work in a more confortable and less frantic manor, to be more patient and positive as I created.

Once again I have tried to build a different relationship with creating sounds in the Nord Modular, and those modules I decide to use. I have reminded myself that the subtle difference of one setting, or sound, to another make all the difference in how something is felt and built upon.

Often in the past I would create music whilst listening to music from someone else, mainly to put me in a mood or to allow me to make clearer connections in my sounds to those that I had been just listening to. A example of this might be to hear a particular artist within a sound, although that sound might be one used by many, or simple a tone. For me, to be able to hear someone else, even if that someone else is myself previously, allows me to hear a context and potential of that sound.

I always work with the understanding that what we hear is in some ways always connected to what we have experienced previously, and so a piece that is completely abstract, needs a consideration to give it the context it needs to be heard 'correctly'. Simply hearing the end result is hugely different to hearing it in development, and so I attempt to find tactics to bring a listener into a place whereby they can be allowed to connect to something else.

Todays sound was also created listening to something else first, and as a result I feel has be able to progress further, finding new textures and complexity that I might have been otherwise tempted to leave out or work around.

Do I like it? well I would have to say I am quite pleased with how it has turned out, although the question is really probably something more like; Is this me?
To that I would probably have to say no, but the quality of the textures is something I am interested in, and certainly something I struggle with in the Nord. 

Ultimately I am quite pleased with todays upload, I hope it brings something to your day too.
