Another sound created to use in our work for Canada in March, please be careful with the volume this is played as it includes some very high frequencies.  
I am not sure at this stage how this sound will be presented, if it will have additional processing or to be used as it is. I guess the sound will dictate this, as it often does.

It is always an exciting time when preparing sounds for a new work, and no matter how often it is done, there is always an element of nerves at play, wondering what it will be like once the time comes. We have worked out what we are doing, and Lucia has already converted yesterdays sound to something she is happy with. I haven't heard it yet and am wondering to wait until a few more are done, I am not sure at this stage. 

Exciting times indeed.
