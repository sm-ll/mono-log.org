More experiments around the concept of the gap, or a silenced part within a loop. 

Again a very quick sketch, in an attempt to not over work anything keeping the sketch to border on cheap and easy, and yet at the same time something that could stand as almost if not totally complete. I feel there is something quite important and unique about the sketch that can stand as more than a working idea.

Thoughts also tonight around an implied genre creating a context to evaluate or understand something, that aims to think more about what a genre can be, or could be, and less what it is now or has been already.

With this in mind, I would very much like to consider these types of uploads simply as Techno. I understand them as Techno, compare them to Techno and also share much of the musical or structure language used in creating Techno.

Regardless of if thought of as actual Techno or not is really beside the point, but I feel by thinking of them as something they might not so easily be thought of, allows a thought towards how one such genre could potentially be.

Techno or not to your ears, hopefully and ultimately it is enjoyable if nothing else.
