Late last night while working on steps for the label Sm-ll, I plugged in to the sounds of <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Farben" title="Jan Jelinek under his alias Farben." target="_blank">Jan Jelinek under his alias Farben.</a>

Jan's work has always caught my ear, being something both abstract yet accesible, smooth and crisp, and mellow yet grooving. Ultimately there is always a time for Jan Jelinek. His work is also enjoyed by my partner Lucia, and so it is great when we remember to put on his work.

More often than not the album that goes in the CD player is his <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Jan-Jelinek-Loop-finding-jazz-records/release/5681?ev=rr" title="Loop-finding-jazz-records" target="_blank">Loop-finding-jazz-records</a> release on the amazing <a href="http://www.scape-music.de/" title="~scape" target="_blank">~scape</a> label, an exciting label thats output seemed to have slipped off my raider and now has ended entirely, which is disappointing.

Unlike normally, the album that filled the room last night was <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Farben-Textstar/release/34632" title="Textstar" target="_blank">Textstar</a>, a much earlier release from Jan Jelinek and arguably ever so slightly edgier sounding as a result. Although all the tracks are great and many seeming to be earlier versions of those found on Loop-finding-jazz-records, one in particular stuck out that's beginning has a smooth and minimal quality, just before the main parts of the track begin.

I really love this beginning and so decided to do something of a homage to Farben, by creating something with this sound in mind. The temptation was there to place the beat along side, as appears in the original, but I resisted and instead made some minor adjustments to the sound to bring it somewhere slightly more in my style perhaps.

I hope you enjoy todays upload, and thank you Jan Jelinek for such great music and inspiration over the years.

(one last thing I just remembered, there was a track I wrote back in 2002-2003, that was actually used in a free download release on the label TIBProd, that was very much inspired by Jan Jelinek, it was called Fruiboize, and is still actually online after just checkingâ€¦we can never escape the internet, <a href="http://www.bek.no/~tibprod/makinoize_fruiboize.mp3" title="feel free to take a listen" target="_blank">feel free to take a listen</a> :)
