I am very excited by tonights upload, and to be honest its not often I really get that.

Perhaps this excitement could be down to the lovely new Glengoyne Whiskey me and Lucia picked up from the incredible Milroys here in London that has slipped down so easily while working on this track. Although this has certainly helped the creative flow tonight, its the outcome of this upload that I am really pleased about. :)

I have spoke with friends before about the way we feel when creating something, and generally I would have to say I come away feeling either ok, or less than ok. Creating for me is not something that is enjoyable like say watching a good movie, or reading a good book, spending time with friends etc. It is a different feeling that is more one that involves frustration, disappointment, patience, with an occasional sense of achievement. This might seem negative, but I don't think so, its just more the way I like it. However, on the odd occasion, things just works that little bit better than expected and 'that' feeling of things just working, is one that is quite nice I have to admit.. If only it was like this more often :)

Anyway, as for the upload itself, it is essentially one patch, copied to a slightly tweaked second running into the Space Echos delay and reverb to add that dub feel. Also there is some additional play with the built in delay on the Inkel mixer. For the last minute or so it is just a single patch on the Nord Modular G1 left raw with no additional effects.

As I have mentioned before I prefer using effects as part of the track structure as apposed to something pasted on top, and so I think its nice to hear the difference when the effects drop entirely. I really like the idea of a track being something that works just as well with effects as without and it uses this back and forth in creating an interesting relationship both in sound and structure.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload as much as I have making it.

Additionally thanks to those who have emailed me recently. It is always nice to meet new people and share experiences, and obviously our passion for the Nord Modular.

Thanks again.
