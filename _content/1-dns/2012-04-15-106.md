A very quick post for this late hour. After traveling and returning home later than expected I am very tired, and so created something simple and textured, that in some ways reminds me of the train travel and its repetitive motion.

Todays sounds also shares some similarity to the results of an experiment I made many years ago, whereby I created grooves in a blank vinyl record using the playing needle of the record player, whilst it recorded the results. What occurs is an incredible repetitive rhythmical dust and pop that you might expect from vinyl, only this as its own locked groove, would slowly build a micro dust pile pattern within the groove, cutting and moving the vinyl material around. Amplified, these rhythmic pops and crackle take on an a aggressive sound that is more <a href="http://www.raster-noton.net/" title="Raster Noton">Raster Noton</a> like in sound quality, than simply the more normal recognisable crackly record.

I hope you enjoy this late upload.
