I am pretty pleased with how this one turned out tonight, specifically the programming side of things. The Nord Modular is definitely starting to gel with me now, with these last few days being a real joy, which as I said before is quite rare. I guess I just like getting stuff done quickly. 

It is a little on the 'nice' side for my taste, but I can't say I am all that bothered, as its a really strong starting point.

This upload is referencing the incredible and timeless album by Taylor Duepree titled <i><a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/stil/" title="Stil" target="_blank">Stil</a></i>, and in particular the track called 'Recur'. 

What I like mostly about this album and this track is the timing shifts that occur. A clicking that sits on the top of the track gives it a pace slightly removed form the rest of the sounds. It also has shifting notes of the stereo field which I like a great deal, and also has a classic touch of moving filter on the hiss texture.

Most of all this track has a sense of patience in its structure. It sits in a loop like state for a long time but shifts in this macro sense, to another similar pattern and balancing of sound. For me this is what stands Stil as such a great release. Its rhythmical on so many layers, and perhaps really only the sort of music that could be made by someone in a shifting transition of their own from more techno-like grooves into that of electronic creative methods.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload, and for those Nord Modular enthusiasts out there, this was only one patchâ€¦yet again the Nord astounds me at its potential.
