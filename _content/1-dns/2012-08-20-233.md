Today I needed something that was easy to create, soothing to listening to, and would massage my temples :)

I decided to create something that used simple tones, all beating in some relation to each other, something I have often worked with before but not so directly in this way. I might explore this a little more in less obvious ways in the future in other uploads, perhaps using filters and envelopes within sequences. We will see.

I hope you can enjoy the simplicity of the beating in todays upload.
