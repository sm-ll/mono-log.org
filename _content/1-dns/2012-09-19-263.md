I think this is probably the first of all the uploads that sound slightly in the ball park of the epic label <a href="http://www.raster-noton.net/" title="Raster Noton" target="_blank">Raster Noton</a>. A label whose music is pretty amazing and whose design is probably that little bit better.

As a label, I have never probably thought of myself as a full on Raster Noton fan as such, I do like the label, but something about it just prevents it from being totally me.

I can't say I have ever put my finger on it, but maybe it is because many of the releases have that typical Raster sound, and if your not with that sound then it can be a difficult one. It could equally be as the releases often seem more and more busy with sound, and dare I say it things are started to sound like they are becoming trendy, and trendy is perhaps thought as one step behind.

However, as is often the case with me, I do really like some of the earlier stuff, or those that are that little more refreshing or challenging. There are some releases on Raster Noton that stand as some of my all time favourites, and much of the packaging is truly beautiful, standing as a huge reminder of the importance of the physical object.

Perhaps one day I will work out exactly what my relationship is with Raster Noton, but until then I will have to pick and choose, which amongst such great material is not such a bad thing at all.

For tonights image, I thought I would search for Raster Repetition in google images and from that <a href="http://blog.h34dup.com/?p=1770" title="found a blog" target="_blank">found a blog</a> that is worth a look through.

Enjoy.
