I have often found when I create with sound, a particular type of sound occurs having a sort of filtered 'thonk!' quality to it. This can be heard slightly in todays upload, an emulation of a sound I had forgot I had created, found on my hardrive this morning. 

I like to think of this sound simply as 'pokk!'. 

The reference being for those who didn't find the garish image for today enough of a hint, is from my memory of my favourite and first Dare Devil comic called Visionaries, written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Smith" title="Kevin Smith">Kevin Smith</a> and illustrated by the incredibly talented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Quesada" title="Joe Quesada">Joe Quesada</a>, and possibly my favourite inker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Palmiotti" title="Jimmy Palmiotti.">Jimmy Palmiotti.</a> What a combination.

The sound comes from when the baton of Dare Devil hits a criminal, or when it rebounds from a wall. For me this aways seemed to give off an unusually comical and harmless sound 'pokk!', even though it 'is' a comic, it seemed even more comical, reminded me of the history and traditions of comics in todays often more graphic content. For me the sound of comics has never been hugely portrayed, with exception of dramatic rain filled panels, this 'pokk!' sound however seemed to fit well with the idea of the sounds I was creating at the time and have used in some of my favourite tracks I have ever written.

As an extension to this, Pokk! has stands as a project title in which I explore this filtered sound a little more though minimal shifting pulsing rhythm's that stylistically perhaps sit somewhere between <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Antti-Rannisto-%C3%84%C3%A4niesineit%C3%A4/release/563535" title="Antti Rannisto's album Ääniesineitä">Antti Rannisto's album Ääniesineitä</a>, <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Taylor-Deupree-Polr/release/16931" title="Polr by Taylor Deupree">Polr by Taylor Deupree</a>, perhaps one of my favourites, and also <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Recon" title="Chirs Coode's Recon project.">Chirs Coode's Recon project,</a> one that seems to have disappeared much like himself.

I hope to share some of these Pokk! ideas in the near future.
