Today has been an interesting day, full of surprises, planning, thinking and new directions.

Tonights upload is perhaps a result of todays events. Something in this sound, and some of the sounds recently seems different and I wonder if this is something to do with how I have been feeling over the last handful of days. 

It is always quite incredible how perspectives on life can have huge influence on creativity.

As I near the end of this year, and I begin to start thinking back to the beginning, for the first time ever I am really able to feel different. A normal year for me has seemed more a blur, with only small changes noticeable, but what I suppose is probably the most creative I have ever been, it is perhaps more like a few of my normal years rolled in to one.

If anyone reading this has had even the slightest thought to do something daily, I highly recommend doing so, and I really can't stress that enough. Mind, if you thought a year goes past quickly normally, this year for me seems to be on x4.

I hope tonights upload is enjoyable. I feel things have shifted slightly in style over the past few days, and so I hope things are still enjoyable for you.

Thanks for listening.
