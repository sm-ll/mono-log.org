Some dub-techno influenced sounds for tonights upload, although much in the mind of one of my favorite albums by <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Antti-Rannisto-%C3%84%C3%A4niesineit%C3%A4/release/563535" title="Anti Rannisto, 'Ääniesineitä'">Anti Rannisto, 'Ääniesineitä'</a>, yet probably having more in common with some of Frank Bretschneider's earlier work of <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Frank-Bretschneider-Looping-I-VI-And-Other-Assorted-Love-Songs/release/261563" title="'Looping I - VI (And Other Assorted Love Songs)'">'Looping I - VI (And Other Assorted Love Songs)'</a>

What I like about Anti Rannisto's album album, is largely the same reasons why I like <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Frank-Bretschneider-Kippschwingungen/release/3611777" title="Frank Bretschneider's 'Kippschwingungen' ">Frank Bretschneider's 'Kippschwingungen' </a>recently released on Line. Although where as Frank seems not able to resist the classic climax in the ending of his work, Anti Rannisto maintains an approach to his album that resembles more a sound block, than a graduale slop upwards.

I very much love Franks album, although I would have to say Anti Rannisto's is perhaps loved that much more. The fact I loved this album, yet resisted it for so long, and was challenged by it, only to really appreciate it fully in more recent years, for me, makes it an incredibly enjoyable work. Perhaps Frank's will do the same in some years to come, who knows.

Anyway, with these works much in mind, I hope you are able to find something new in my upload, and that perhaps fits into more my recent ideas an sketchs that I have shared.

Enjoy.
