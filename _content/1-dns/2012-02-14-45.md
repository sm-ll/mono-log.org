A quick and brief entry today. 

This one is experiments in finding ways to create as close as I can to the sound of <a href="http://www.create.ucsb.edu/PulsarGenerator/" title="Pulsar Synthesis. ">Pulsar Synthesis. </a>

Although technically this is incorrect, the similarities in how one pulse influences another in peaks and filter-like ways, much like the correct version, does yield a pleasing result.

As I say this is only a brief post, so I hope you enjoy the upload.
