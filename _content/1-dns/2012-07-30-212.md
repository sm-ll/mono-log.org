Today I have been listening to the incredible work of <a href="http://www.repeatle.com/" title="Mokira, one of Andreas Tilliander" target="_blank">Mokira, one of Andreas Tilliander</a>'s alias's and the name of which he went under for his seminal release <a href="http://www.raster-noton.net/main.php?action=products&dat=37" title="ClipHop on Raster Noton" target="_blank">ClipHop on Raster Noton</a> as part of the Static Series.

What I love about Andrea's work is not only his ease of moving between variations of electronic music, but that his sound within all that he does is clear to be heard. 

For someone who has always found it difficult in the past to feel confident or comfortable in any one genre, Andrea's seems effortless in moving around, something I really admire. I can't say I like everything he does, but what I do like, I like a great deal. Having said that, even the work that I find more difficult is not due to quality, as it is all amazing, but simply a difference in taste.

I also like the roughness to his sounds and tracks, and additionally the way he seems to create melodic suggestions within his music, something I have always personally preferred in most music I listen to and create myself. More a case of finding a balance of sounds and resonances of those sounds to create interplay between them, bringing out something that could not really be so easily created any other way.

Andrea's work is certainly one of those artists that for the most part almost entirely slipped by me for years, with the exception of his track <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Various-Clicks-Cuts-3/master/5768" title="Nerdy South on the last Clicks and Cuts" target="_blank">Nerdy South on the last Clicks and Cuts</a> I ever bought. The more I hear of his work now the more I can recognise his influence on other artists, those that I did follow. He most certainly would have had a huge influence on me back in 2000-2001 when I was listening to Clicks and Cuts on almost constant repeat, It is strange that his music for the most part passed me by for so long, as clearly it is exactly the sort of thing I like. 

I can't help wonder again if my missing his music was a case of me subconsciously avoiding what I clearly like, in fear of being so easily influenced by it. It wouldn't be the first time, but most certainly not something I do or worry about these days. My growing up in a small, cut off seaside town takes its toll I guessâ€¦haha

I hope you enjoy tonights upload.
