Some more textures for tonights upload, much like yesterdays in spirit although this one having a much cleaner or rawer sound by comparison, typically a sound of layered tones. Although quite simple and perhaps in need of a little more tweaking or further processing, but still hopefully having some interesting sounds.

Again the Nord is a delight to use, playing with simple tones and noise, bouncing from speaker to speakerâ€¦I probably wont tire of this sound for a long time.

I hope you enjoy.
