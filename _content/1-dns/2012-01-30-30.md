I am finding the complexity of the patch while working with FM Synthesis to really affect the sounds made with it. An experience of being totally lost in a patch, confused almost by its complex nature, visually and also audibly, that is in turn hugely influencing the end result. It's not to say the end result is as a result better or worse, but more a challenge found in the particular type of sounds being made. They are sharp and tire the ears far quicker than normal sounds, and so finding a balance in among the endless possibilities of the patch is a challenging task indeed. What might perhaps be initially heard to me as a hard edged, aggressive and overly powerful sound while sat looking at the patch, later becomes a much more delicate and fair texture of sound, with relatively no aggression as easily found.

While working with other sound creation software I would generally turn away from the computer screen, turn it off altogether or record out ideas to CD to listen back to at a later stage. This separation from the sound making tools and the sound itself I find stands as an essential part of working with sound and getting the most from it. The image influences the ears hugely and with the added tiring of the ears, it is easy for sounds to become confused and overworked, something I certainly am finding evident in todays upload. 

In my daily life I like things neat and tidy, functional, practical, with a high consideration to space, clean lines and I am constantly asking myself the importance and relevance of what I own and if I can't remove it, improve it or “leave it alone”, words I often hear expressed from my partner. My desk is white and as empty as it can be, my iPhone has its apps hidden away on a second page, with only the phone and message icons appearing on all. I own just enough clothes, I have a morning and evening ritual, and get extremely excited by organisation programs, to do lists, white boards, typography and various other geeky things. I find organisation, structure and systems a very important attribute to helping me concentrate and feel relaxed while I work and play and find the way I work with patches and sounds in the Nord no different in that respect.

When thinking about creating with sound in general, it is less about making it fit a genre, or a form that comes out of what I am simply able to achieve, but more an aim towards something that feeds this perspective I have towards life and how I live mine. This consideration in how we experience in general, is an essential element and powerful catalyst of creativity for me. Rarely can I just create for the sake of creating, there needs to be some consideration to how it is experience, its context, what information and system of presentation is used, the restrictions imposed. It is with all these considerations that allow me to think and work well. It is these things that I believe enables wonderful and challenging things to happen that would have not been normally been achievable.

In considering all these things, I want to attempt in simplifying my patches even further, to concentrate on creating sounds that work in a interconnected relationship to themselves and the space around them, holding them together in a stronger bond and body of sound. An almost system of sound, an evidence of consideration to sound, and something that ultimately does just enough to form. I guess tomorrow will tell how this all works out.
