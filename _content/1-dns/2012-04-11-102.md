A late upload today, or rather early morning, but one I hope is worth the wait, at least I am excited by this one :)

I have often mentioned in previous posts about my influence and inspiration coming from a few particular releases but in particular <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Stephan-Mathieu-Full-Swing-Edits/release/155205" title="Full Swing Edits by Stephan Mathieu" target="_blank">Full Swing Edits by Stephan Mathieu</a>. For those of you who haven't heard of this release I can't recommend it enough. It is a release for me that stands away from much of the work around at that time, and still to this days sounds incredibly fresh and inspiring.

Todays upload is something made very much with a similar sound and feel to the album Full Swing Edits, and also a nod to previous uploads I have made. It further explores the balance of noise, texture, tone and melodic, presented in a sort of fractured delivery of sound. This has alway been a quality of sound I have worked with for well…since the beginning of making music. My very first decent pieces of electronic music, that I only have tape recordings of (but no original tape) shares this heavy bass tone and fuzz that fluctuates, and still stands as perhaps my favourite music I have ever created. It always amuses me that favourites of my own work, are often those created when I wasn't even old enough to buy a pack of cigarettes, not that I smoke, and so often wonder to revisit those old pieces to recreate or develop…perhaps I will one day.

One thing I have neglected to mention in the past about the release Full Swing Edits, is the incredible design work of Angela Lorenz (pictured above), or 'Alorenz' as she is often credited. Her work is probably one of the very first examples of design and design methodology that inspired me, and certainly egged me into creating many of my own generative images using the software <a href="http://processing.org/" title="Processing" target="_blank">Processing</a>. Just on a side note, if you are interested in coding or generative images, sketches for visual work etc, then I highly recommend looking at <a href="http://processing.org/" title="Processing" target="_blank">Processing</a>. It is free and quite beautiful in what it produces and how it is used.

Finally, thanks to everyone who has been supporting my creations/posts, it all really means a great deal. It is you and your feedback that is getting me through some of these tough and uninspired days. I would love to say making something each day has got easier or routine for me, but it hasn't. I generally find doing anything productive very difficult, and although I am often seen to be doing lots, I am someone who struggles with <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=making+ideas+happen" title="making ideas happen" target=_blank">making ideas happen</a>. It is still very hard work, but ultimately an incredibly enjoyable process, hearing the results and your enjoyment of them.

Thanks again, and I hope you enjoy todays upload.
