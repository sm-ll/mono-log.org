I have been working a great deal over recent days with grid systems, CYMK colouring and positive and negative space. In this way of working I am often drawn to comparing the creation and working methods of design and sound. I have been considering the roles of each in society, culture and the self and pondering the frameworks that often surround these.

Although it is clear that stylistic choices, influence and admiration might be key contributors to the development of a framework, I wonder if in some creative areas and professions, these are often considered as mere attachments to what is otherwise quite a free framework, free to move on its own accord seemingly no more attached to its creator than it is the world it belongs and/or contributes to.

I have decided to work quite specifically in developing a framework for my experiments each day with an ultimate aim towards the ‘idea’ of innovation in sound creation found in electronic music. I feel, and I must admit at this point it is only a feeling, that there is a general lack and oversight on the part of many, when considering their role in the development and progression of the niche world of sound creation that they are contributing to. The tendency at the moment, ‘seems’ at least, to be more about creating music after the fact, a game of ‘fit in and sound like that which came before’ seems more prevalent than it once was. This present act of looking back and borrowing, seems apposed to what seemed before as more the shared notion of looking ahead and pushing the genres to the limits of its own framework. What seemed almost an unspoken but shared belief in the importance of developing a genre, is seemingly lost in an arguably over saturation of creative output being put into the public domain.

It is the framework that I feel stands as the glue in which context can be created and understood, and it is this which proposes a notion of belonging and of recognising, or alternatively one of resisting and rejecting. Ultimately a clearer understanding of what fits and what doesn’t forms along a line of definition, its fairest reaches perhaps defined as in and out to the general listeners taste and experience.

Is it this very framework that is missing as an integral factor towards the creative choices, delivery and general overall process of generating and submitting the many sub genres of electronic music?
