Another variation <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_53/" title="of a previous upload" target="_blank">of a previous upload</a>. This one is a resonant swelling of tones, using high resonant filters. 

I must be honest I am not entirely convinced by this one, although it does have some interesting things happening in it. I like the way the texture of the noise seeps through the tones, but also perhaps more interesting for me, is being able to hear the repetition of that noise through the resonance.

Myself and Lucia have both experimented with noise, Lucia having even <a href="http://www.weeld.net/colourofquantum.html" title="released her debut cd">released her debut cd</a> this year, spilt with Yuki Aida, and this being specifically working with white noise. We have both enjoyed finding the patterns in noise and through the filtering away of frequencies it is interesting to hear the pseudo random algorithms hidden within the noise. With our ears not being able to perceived the patterns repetition unless listening very carefully, are presented a clearer awareness of this repetition through filtering. I think its great, if a little geeky.

So although this upload is not overly satisfying in terms of the style, it is hopefully interesting to compare it to that of the <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_53/" title="initial version uploaded last week">initial version uploaded last week</a>, and see if a pattern can easily emerge when listening to it closely.
