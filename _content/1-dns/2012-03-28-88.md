This morning I awoke early, partly due to hearing the timeless and beautiful chord sequence of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UmOY6ek_Y4" title="Jan Hammer's Crockett's Theme" target="_blank">Jan Hammer's Crockett's Theme</a> in my dream, a great way to start any morning, but I was also excited at the prospect of beginning to create todays sound using a photograph I spotted yesterday taken by the incredibly talented Sound Artist and Photographer, <a href="http://www.behance.net/sogar_heckel" title="Jürgen Heckel" target="_blank">Jürgen Heckel</a>, otherwise known as <a href="http://www.monohr.com/Sogar.html" title="Sogar" target="_blank">Sogar</a>, whose <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/artists/sogar/" title="12k releases are all worth purchasing." target="_blank">12k releases are all worth purchasing.</a> 

All of Jürgen's photography is well worth taking a look at also, with each collection of photos revealing more and more into each theme. The photo used for today's upload is taken from the <a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Surge/2659967" title="Surge collection" target="_blank">Surge collection</a>, although I have to say I like them all, specifically the collections 'Series', 'Grass' and 'Herde', all amazing work.

I pleased to find Jürgen's work again, it has been a long time since the last time I have enjoyed it, and the first time I have seen his photography, so it is great to revisit old works and experience new.

For todays sound, I certainly had the slightly heavier sound of Sogar in my mind while I created it, although I must say after quickly listening to his work again yesterday, I found it to be far more musical and softer than I remembered. Still, with this in mind, and with Jürgen's image open on my other computer, I was inspired to create a dense, lost, electrical or static sound. 

I also thought of field recording trips and standing still in cold conditions. I also remembered the noise often found in my recordings when listening back, that often seemed lost at the time of recording and experiencing such things like such structures framed by Jürgen.

Clearly my imagination was fuelled and excited, and so perhaps the sound for todays upload can be used in much the same way when listened back.

Thanks to Jürgen, for allowing me to use his amazing photograph, and please do take the time to <a href="http://www.behance.net/sogar_heckel" title="see his other remarkable work." target="_blank">see his other remarkable work.</a>
