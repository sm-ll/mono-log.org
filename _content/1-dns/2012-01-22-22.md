I mentioned in the previous post <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_13/" title="Snd 13 - [13.01.2012]">Snd 13 - [13.01.2012]</a> about a kind of sound artefact that appears when working with the Nord, which I described as a sort of dusty washed out fuzz that occurs when moving the volume dial. 

Todays upload is to demonstrate this sound which I have also found to occurs in stereo or amplitude changes. In a way this upload today is partly the ways it is due for a want to reach this dusty fuzz without simply moving a dial manually, and as a result has an unusual and interesting quality to it I feel. 

The actual specific sound I am talking about is the occasional thumping with subtle rasping to it.

This is actually Sunday's sound, but after being away for the weekend I have only had the chance to upload now, enjoy.
