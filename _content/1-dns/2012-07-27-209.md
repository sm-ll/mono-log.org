So today I thought I would dive into Techno a little more and create something of a homage to one artist who was hugely influential in my time with Techno, and that would be <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/JB%C2%B3" title="Joey Beltram" target="_blank">Joey Beltram</a>.

For me, while everyone else was listening to Jeff Mills, another amazing Techno artist, I was listening to the sounds of Joey Beltram and his incredible hard hitting sounds, with sharp kicks and FM synthesis that could cut through many speaker cones. I still have yet to hear anyone do it like he could do it back in the mid to late 90s.

Although Beltram is still going today, for me is was the epic album Places, others around that time, and the first lot of releases as JB³ on NovaMute that really stood out as something special.

For todays upload I have created something that is somewhere between <i>Believer</i> and <i>The Works</i>, both tracks on the first JB³ release I ever bought. This Nord patch is two patches, one dealing with the FM synth stabs and the other dealing with a light click-like kick drum and shuffling, filtering hats.

I could have sat with this patch for ages, tweaking and tweaking, but decided I should just upload, along with a very rough and ready jam of some of the settings. If I was to do this properly, I would have probably get busy on mid-filter sweeps, and balancing the volumes along with some subtle crunch and reverb.

This is 100% Nord, no EQ on the horrible mixer I have and once again demonstrating the incredible flexibility of the amazing machine. I am really always stunned at the sound of the Nord Modular.

I hope you enjoy todays Techno sounds.
