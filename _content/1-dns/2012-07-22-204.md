A revisiting to the pulse sound, a style I haven't uploaded on this blog for a while.

This upload a very simple pulse, experimenting with a filter module I haven't used much before, creating a much cleaner or sharper sound. Also using a module I love using for this type of sound, the EQ module. With these sharper, shorter sounds, it transforms it to a very hollow quality of sound. I believe through the way it processes the sounds it receives, there is certainly some windowing or something similar, that becomes very noticeable.

I am thinking to experiment more with this type of sound, as it is one I quite enjoy working with and they do sound great with subtle reverb, although not a feature of the G1 Nord unfortunately.

Minimal sounds, and ones I hope you enjoy.
