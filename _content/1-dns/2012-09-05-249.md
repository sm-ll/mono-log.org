Some wobbly dub influenced grooves for tonights upload. 

This began out as sounds influenced by my record crackle experiments found at my <a href="http://soundcloud.com/moize" title="Soundcloud" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> page. I was listening to these, reminding myself of where I have come from, what got me here…and also that I should upload some new edits from this blog, sorry about that :)

Form these shifting crackles in vinyl, I decided on using the drumsynth module along with some basic envelopes, and some various other bits and bobs to create something that has more in common with perhaps the underbelly of these record crackles than the obviously audible pops and hiss found at the surface.

I remember when creating these crackles the studio monitors were loud and the bass was heavy, heavier than it is on the recordings. I have often enjoyed finding grooves or subtle shifts within bass frequencies and generally feel these frequencies, get left for rooting a track, more than being one all by themselves.

This reminds me of when I first heard <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw7TY-zPaas" title="Aphex Twin's Ageispolis" target="_blank">Aphex Twin's Ageispolis</a>, on my late night taped copy of the classic TV program <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IheGLbHjbTE&list=PL32E3AD5FDACC55FE&index=4&feature=plpp_video" title="BPM presented by Dave Dorell and Brenda Tuohy" target="_blank">BPM presented by Dave Dorell and Brenda Tuohy</a>…a track that was an ear opener for me at the time of 15/16 years of age, and influencing my music creating a great deal. Obviously this track was largely bass sounds for what is reallly the melodic part. An amazing work, and from an amazing album which is perhaps his best of all.

Anyway, its late…enjoy the upload…and the Joey Beltram interview…classic.
