Tonights upload is a little bit of an experiment in balancing bass and noise textures, and so probably a little odd sounding, although probably not so much to those who sit in the studio for hours on end :)

Not a lot to say about this upload really, other than this direction is quite likely come from being influenced by some particularly good sounds today that I have had the pleasure of hearing.

Hope you enjoy it.
