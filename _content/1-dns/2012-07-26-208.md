Been wanting to do this sort of upload since the beginning, and someone via twitter inspired me to do so.

I first heard this sort of work with simple sine tones through the work of Ryoji Ikeda on the compilation of <a href="http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/catalogue/t_zero_0_touch_sampler_00.html" title="Touch Sampler 00" target="_blank">Touch Sampler 00</a>. Although heard in my studio many times and in many of yours I am sure. To have it as an actual release was really the amazing thing for me, and more importantly as the opening track of this CD. It was truly very inspiring, and was played by me any times during DJ sets around that time.

Thank you for your inspiration and reminder today analogue01 :)

I hope you enjoy this simple sine.
