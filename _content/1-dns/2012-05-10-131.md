Today I went through some of the previous uploads listening to them on my home stereo speakers. I used to do this at the beginning when starting this blog, but haven't done this for a while. I must admit it was quite a quick listen through, and mainly listening to these previous uploads to understand the language of my own sound that perhaps I am a little numbed to.

Well I can say for sure it was a really worthwhile experience and one that has certainly assisted in what sort of sound the first release of Sm-ll might be. The first release being what will also make up the first in the 'Series', the more conceptual continuum of releases.

So todays upload is most certainly a sound created out of this reflection on previous uploads, and although perhaps again not quite what I was intending, it is again a case of that time will tell upon reflection, how this stands up against other uploads and is considered as a possible starting point towards a release.

I feel it is a long way to go, and these uploads although seemingly like tracks in some ways, are not to my ears, and so I am quite excited at the prospect of how things will sound when things 'are' considered tracks to me. Indeed, very exciting times ahead.

I will leave it here with todays post as I am off to eat, followed by an event this evening. Oh, one last thing, I thought I would share a picture of me, that will be used on the new Mimosa Moize blog (coming soon), and that was obviously taken by me back in 2008â€¦so now you know what I sort of look like if you didn't already.

I hope you find todays upload enjoyable.
