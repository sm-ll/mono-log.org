Further variations on <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_57/" title="last weeks sound upload" target="_blank">last weeks sound upload</a>, and I must say this one come about sort of by accident, but I liked it and wanted to share it.

A very ominous chord, and one of those sounds that really seemed unreal to be coming out of the synth that was moments before delivering a quite clean collections of tones. This sound seems touched by subtle reverb but the Nord Modular G1 has no reverb or substantial delay to speak of. Again I am stunned at what this synth can do.
