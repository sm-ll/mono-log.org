Some experiments with FM synthesis, modelled around the Roland TR606 Hat sound as a starting point, but working the sound to resemble more a feel of that when creating techno grooves.

It starts off kind of odd, but after some time I found it quite hypnotic and so left it as raw as I could, resisting the temptation to add more than was needed.

I slowly tweaked some EQ on my little mixer as I recorded it, but other than that it is all straight from the one patch on the Nord Modular.

I hope you enjoy it.
