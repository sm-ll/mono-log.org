Some smooth tones and textures for tonights upload, after feeling a little break from rhythmical stuff is perhaps needed, to be able to go back again fresh.

I have often found switching between styles and types of creation keeps things sounding interesting, and have often enjoyed the work of artists when they create music outside of their normal expected style.

Surgeons abstract ambient music for John Peel many years back, and also the largely unheard Autechre-esque track by Boards of Canada, also a piece for John Peel. These sorts of adventures into different styles is a joy to hear, specifically when hearing the lesser expected language of each artist, in these other works.

Still till this day it is a joy to hear artists studio ideas and sketches that would neer be released, and hearing and understanding their needs to venture into different styles to keep them sounding good.

I often find a single style to sit well with me for long periods, and need a type of structure in place to almost take care of this for me, allowing me to feel free within restrictions.

Although this upload shares much similarity to some others, I hope it breaks up your listening as much as I hope it does my creating.
