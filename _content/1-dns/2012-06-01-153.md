A few post ago, during a prolific and generally positive and productive day, I created two uploads, from within the same patch.

I had kept one aside, debating if to upload it or not, as thinking I quite like it enough to be the basis of a more complete track. Another part of my not sharing it was it was created in the same day, and typically for me I am a stickler for systems and sticking to them. Creating a sound day, wouldn't be so if I used one from a previous day.

I kind of thought it is a shame I can't share it, until I realised how silly I was being, and that I should just upload it. Still unable to do so, it has taken today and my having to catch a train to Southampton to support a friend <a href="http://www.kimvi.co.uk/" title="Kimvi Nyugen" target="_blank">Kimvi Nyugen</a> on her opening of her solo show. (you may recognise her name, she provide art work for a few Mimosa Moize releases)

It was then I remembered that my partner <a href="http://www.weeld.net/colourofquantum.html" title="Lucia" target="_blank">Lucia</a>, has also <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_86/" title="done an upload" target="_blank">done an upload</a>, and I also had to do two a day, <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_59/" title="creating variations of previous sounds" target="_blank">creating variations of previous sounds</a>, while in preparation for our trip to Montreal.

So, I am very pleased to share a very minimal, repetitive and exciting upload created last Saturday. I realise how me and my father are perhaps more alike in this matter than I first thought :)

I hope you enjoy todays upload.
