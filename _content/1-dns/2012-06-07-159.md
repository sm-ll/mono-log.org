I was originally going to mention how todays upload resembled the likes of <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/surgeon" title="Surgeon" target="_blank">Surgeon</a>, in the folding and intensity of the tones and rhythmical feel, and yet as I listen back to todays upload away from the Nord Modular, I am again completely blown away at how different it sounds a few minutes after making it.

I suppose it does still have this sinister edge to it, but the agression seems to have almost entirely evaporated and been replaced by something much calmer and subdued.

I think it is probably best I write nothing more than 'enjoy todays upload', and let you decide.
