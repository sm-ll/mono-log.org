After a long break traveling to Taiwan, getting married, having a Haney Mel (honeymoon) I have finally found some more time to sit down and create something to upload, and today it is with my new toy, the Korg Volca Sample.

In a wordâ€¦ 'amazing'.

Go buy one, get <a href="http://www.singlecellsoftware.com/cevs" target="_blank">this software from Single Cell Software</a>, save using the deal breaking iPhone transfer/editor, and also get excited about the <a href="http://www.korg.com/us/news/2014/1118/" target="_blank">SDK release</a>. It even comes with batteries included, what more can you ask for.

Today's upload was created sampling various bits from my own stuff and created all in the Volca, what you hear is all Volca Sample.

Enjoy.

P.S. Happy New Year.
