Today I have been listening back to some of the recent uploads through our home speakers.

It was a really enjoyable experience to hear them all one after another, and so very different to the experience of creating them each day. Even those that I wasn't so sure of sounded much better than I expected, and after hearing them I am very excited to get some to vinyl in the near future.

As a result of this reflection today, I have been able to explore some more abstract rhythmical ideas, focusing once again on the gaps between sounds, and trying out ideas within that kind of spluttering dub-techno like feel I have shared often.

I am looking forward to listening again to older uploads, and must remember to do this more often.

I hope you enjoy tonights sketch and thanks again for all the support.
