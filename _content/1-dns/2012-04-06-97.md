Back at the end of last year I wrote something for the free download <a href="http://www.dragonseyerecordings.com/catalogue/de6010.html" title="Dragon's Eye compilation Iron" target="_blank">Dragon's Eye compilation Iron</a>, a piece that was based around field recordings exchanged between Yann & Robert, myself and Lucia. In this work I decided to emulate some of the interesting knocks and pops heard in the recording, and also the drone and rumble caused by the traffic outside Yann's studio in LA.

For me this was a challenging project, mainly due to not having submitted anything under my own name for a very long time. I found creating the sounds in the Nord seemed to make things work for me, fitting a language of working I remembered and understood when working alone, and the resulting track <i>A Broken Field III</i>, was actually the third attempt I had wrote that week and first that seemed to work for me. 

I think part of the reason this particular track worked and other didn't, was I also included an additional sound that was created completely separate from working with the field recordings, and as a result created a sort of glue that brought everything together, not only just for the sounds but also due to its familiarity for me. This new additional sound in its raw form was one I had heard many times having lived on my hard drive for a few years prior.

Todays sound, takes a version of this raw sound as inspiration but brings it back to the Nord Modular from where it originated. In addition to this, I feel this new version has also brought with it some of the knocking and popping introduced initially in A Broken Field III, originally inspired by the clicking of the record button, mouse button, and subtle movement by Yann to be heard in his studio that day. I think this is quite interesting.

Todays photo, was a tricky one. I wanted something that might be suggestive of a full circle, but no sooner did I have the recycled symbol in my mind, it remained there insisting I think of nothing else…clearly this would not do :)

I have always enjoyed experiencing the desk space of people, understanding their territory. This fascination is also found in musician and artists alike, and finding a little about the environment in which they work. When thinking back to Yann's studio, one I have never visited and know little about, I can only use what knowledge I have to piece together that environment, how it might sound, feel or function. 

Finally, in consideration of all this, I decided it was only fitting that a little more of <i>my</i> work place is revealed, and that perhaps this might be something of interest to people like myself, and maybe it change slightly how things sound or feel…

I hope you enjoy todays upload.
