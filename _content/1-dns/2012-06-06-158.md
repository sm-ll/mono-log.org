Today was been a good day, but not in the sense of getting things done, as sometimes I might define a good day, but in another way entirely.

Today I finished some work that has been hovering for longer than I would have liked it, and for the first time in a while I felt a little more relaxed and decided after a late night working to take a nap.

I haven't long awoken from this nap and haven't even created the sounds for this upload yet. I felt compelled before I did anything else to share the dream I had, a reoccurring dream and one that I have spoken about before on this blog, only this time the dream perspective has changed, and for the very first time in my life.

Just a quick recap on what the reoccurring dream consists of.

Initially I am stood outside a kinda of window area, its dark where I am stood and I am looking in to a light area where people are sat around a table eating their meal. I always consider this time to be around 6pm, or what I grew up being called tea-time. 

When I was young, the people sat around the table resembled the Munsters, or the Adam's Family in appearance. I am not sure why but I do remember watching this a fair bit as a child, and thinking back now I believe appart from the comedy, I liked its perspective being a family that is essentially outcast in their society, functioning very much in the way they feel is correct for them. I think I must had made some connection there.

In my dream this Munster-esque family meal, was different in that there was no comedy here. The faces of the people were very drawn, and they were not eating but looking out at me. On occasion a blurring of what could be a figured passed by behind their table in the distance. I always felt this motion in the background sort of amplified the stillness of the family looking out.

As is the tendency with dreams, it seemed to disappear for a long time, only to reappear 3 or 4 year ago. This time I was stood outside what was more an illuminated shop window, its window the size of the shop front. The door on the right was open, also made of glass, and people were going inside, again with me stood outside in the dark looking in. Unlike the Munster setting, this one was more a vibrant and active place, the people looking alive for starters. Also interestingly they were beckoning me in, and I wanted to go in, but stayed where I was, in the dark just watching. I only had this version once, and have not had this dream again until today.

Todays dream was very different, and to be honest I didn't even recognise it at first as the same dream even. It wasn't until I woke up, reflecting on the comical element of it, that it suddenly dawned on me what it actually was. In the past I have practiced understanding my dreams insofar that when I try to remember them, I noticed how often I would disregard some aspects of the dream as absurd and exclude them from my thoughts. I realised that this is perhaps the essence of the dream, and that I should really try hard to include this, and so I will do my best to use this now as I write about this dream.

I was sat at a table, a very long table, it felt like tea-time, but I was sat at the far side, almost on the corner next to a wall that seemed very dark. I would have to say a dim corner of the table. Immediately opposite me was a young lad, who I considered younger than me, he had reddish styled hair, those big trendy shades on, and clearly took care of his appearance. I was to find out during the dream he was an inspiring or emerging curator, he didn't say much. Sat to his left moving into the table was Carsten Nicolai. I have never met Carsten in real life, although passed him by once without full realising it, I would have spoke had I noticed. He was very talkative in this dream and generally very unlike his stern and clinical image, and instead much more flamboyant. Perhaps he is like this in real life, I don't know. Opposite him and I feel sitting next to me, was someone who could have been Frank Bretschneider, but this wasn't clear, it could have also been Richard Chartier, and I feel these faces melted into each other with nothing seeming overly clear, as is often the case with dreams. There were other pople at the table, and many I had the feeling I knew, the furthest of them was Helen Frosi of Soundfjord gallery, sat at the furthest end from me, although I never actually saw her. I think for me this table was full of who I considered a combination of my friends, my colleagues and perhaps my herosâ€¦although Bruce Willis wasn't there, haha.

It started with me talking a lot, asking lots of questions, then as the dream progressed the people around me seemed to get older, much much older, like in their 70s or 80s. At this point I was quiet, and Carsten was talking about his club in Iceland and his comical troubles within his carrer, it's unclear exactly what, but the sort of stories you would expect to hear around a dinner table full of this type of guest.I remember someone taking a photo of the event before we all parted, at which point Carsten commented on the red boys hair being messy and if he should take his career seriously he should address his fringe.

I imagine you are thinking much like I was at the time of waking up, in how silly this dream seems. It does, I agree. It was then I realised the similarities, the patterns within it, the darkness, the time, the positioning and the people. I feel from my initial interpretation it is that I have now joined the very edge of what I seemed so fond of looking at. I am still a little in the dark, but active in what I believe in. I am perhaps realising that those whom I admire are of a different era from me, and that although knowing from the young age of 10 years old that I wanted to create and be involved in the world of electronic music, I was not ready for various reasons to be fully involved in the ways I would like. The time I admire so much is perhaps due to it being so fulfilling, there was nothing that period needed. Now that period has gone and I certainly do not feel fulfilled. I feel it is the perspective of me who has changed in this dream, and the age of those in it also changing all points to this, and points to the suggestion of a new era, a new adventure that is not one I will watch and admire, but one I will be involved in.

I recently spoke to a friend, giving what support and advice I could, explaining that the people we admire and would love to work with, are perhaps not always the same people we will or should work with. The people that we work with are perhaps as unknown as we are, and it will be that group that will give something to the group that follows.

I feel ultimately this dream is also obviously some affirmation of what and where I am now. I am consciously challenging myself and my perspective of myself and the things around me, and undoubtably this blog and those I have met and spoke to through it is playing a crucial part in shaping this perspective and changing the structure of that dinning table.

Finally, the dinning table or more specifically tea-time, is something that stands as a representation of where you are and who you associate with. I find this shares some similarities to having those who visit your home, and in turn also invite you to theirs. It is a sharing of trust and a demonstration of a bond that can be built. Tea-time is similar in that it encompasses a context that encapsulates a variety of people in your life. Work colleagues, friends, family and beyond, can all share time around a dinning table during an evening meal. You may never hear from some people again, but the time you shared was hopefully an enjoyable one.

This was a long post, and I appreciate and thank you for your time in getting this far for those of you who are reading this. I feel excited, focused, and feel another cog has turned for me. When I think of all the things I am planning this year, it is dreams like this that make them all the more a reality.

I hope you enjoy the upload, I have no idea what it is yet, but judging by the objects are on my desk I am hopeful their inspiration will lead me.
