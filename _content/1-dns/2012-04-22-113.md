So, the day began quite well with some good news, followed by some great racing that me and Lucia watched together that ended with an excellent result from a driver we both support a great deal. After which I decided I would spend a good chunk of my Sunday not working (as I would normally) but pushing the Nord Modular into the sound of dub, a style I have been finding difficult to extract from it without the use of other tools.

I seems I have often created sounds/tracks in a dub style, and even in the past when I didn't find the attraction to certain dub music, I have found on reflection that some of my earliest creations where in fact in this very style. It seems at this time back in the beginning I just wasn't thinking of the music I created in this way, and really thought of it more as Kraftwerk inspired, which it was. I wondered if it is my perspective looking back that has attributed a dub sound to these early creations, or if in fact it is really that it was always there and as I say, I was unable to take that perspective at the time.

So, it would take many years later until I would find my way into the dub sound, initially in the form of artist <a href="http://www.pole-music.com/" title="Stefan Betke as Pole" target="_blank">Stefan Betke as Pole</a>. Shortly after I temporarily left Techno to enjoy the height of electronic music in the UK which influenced me tremendously, almost to the point of regret actually, I was to discover Pole and this discovery would then lead me to <a href="http://www.scape-music.de/" title="~Scape" target="_blank">~Scape</a>, releasing amazing albums such as <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Kit-Clayton-Nek-Sanalet/master/60881" title="Kit Clayton's Nek Sanalet" target="_blank">Kit Clayton's Nek Sanalet</a>, an album that I really need to revisit, and other artists <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Jelinek" title="Jan Jelinek" target="_blank">Jan Jelinek</a> and other great ~scape artists.

I was after playing a few shows in London that a friend Chris introduced me to <a href="http://www.echocord.com/" title="Echo Chord" target="_blank">Echo Chord</a>, <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Rod+Modell" title="Rod Modell" target="_blank">Rod Modell</a> and more.

And yet I still have always considered myself generally outside of this genre and know a lot less about it than I would like. I find, as I did mostly when I was younger, that it is often my perspective of things that largely govern how I situate myself within any musical context, or what I think of myself belonging too. I suppose a general sense of placement is always challenged possibly partially through my fascination with influence, context and hidden social structures we abide by or resist against.

Before I move off point to a world of thought that is perhaps best left for another post, I want to address the Nord Modular upload for today.

Normally when creating something I would sit down and try to find a new way to use it, or challenge myself directly in how I use it, as if that using it any other way is not challenging, which is of course silly. Today I decided to relax and just let things happen, and used a method I used to use many years ago when writing Techno, whereby I would listen to a general feel, sound or texture of that genre moments before writing my own. This wasn't for a desire to copy, although I don't feel anything is wrong with that, but more to position myself, to feel I was somewhere already hours on in the creation process, and provided a kinda of feeling or focus point I could aim for. It seemed to work again today.

I have used 4 patches this time, which I think is the first time I have done this, but not for a want to complicate the sound, but to find a way to create an atmosphere with the sound due to the Nord having no reverbs, delays etc to spatialise the sound. I feel this work around has worked quite well and I am pleased with todays upload. It reminds me of how little I tend to use effects, and I am pleased to get this Nord Modular sounding dubby once more.

I have to say I owe this upload to some of you who have reminded me of music that I had almost forgotten about, and the feeling that comes with listening to this sort of music. For this I am truly grateful, and hope to upload plenty more dub-like efforts.

I think its safe to say my Pokk! project is on its return.
