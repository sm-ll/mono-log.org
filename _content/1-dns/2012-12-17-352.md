Tonight I was hoping to share with you some Nord Modular sounds along with my new analog delay, the Dynacord VRS-23â€¦however it has a rather noisy buzzing problem, wich is slightly annoying to say the least.

There are few possible solutions, although I am really totally useless when it comes to electronics, and am very much take appart, blow, wiggle and put back together hoping it works kinda-guy.

Still, I hope to get something uploaded soon, so fingers crossed tomorrow is that day.

Instad, I created something using my trusty 606 and 303 styled patches, a low rumbling textured shuffling through dub. I kind of like it.

I hope you do too.
