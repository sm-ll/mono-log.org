Today I was reminded of the very tempting modifications for the TR-606 drum machine. I remember these modifications many years ago when I had my first 606, I even modified this one with the individual outputs for each drum sound. Surprisingly though I actually sold this machine, not liking the flexibility it gave me and finding I always preferred the single output, or single output with louder headphones output combo.

Well, many years on and I am reminded again on Facebook on the modifications, (I wish I could link to the person who reminded me but its vanished), and was <a href="http://www.confusedmachines.com/" title="pointed to a website">pointed to a website</a> showing the kits and some sound files of what it does. Its pretty interesting, and I would love to have a go on one, although I know I can't bring myself to change my 606 again.

So instead of modifying my trusty silver box, I decided to work a little more on my 606 modular patch, improving the sounds even more and adding some control from the dials to change the sounds in much the way a modification kit might. 

I have to say I like it, and no holes drilled :)

All the tweaking of the sounds was done live, so my hands were quite busy. I wanted to create something that really made use of the sound changes in a constructive way, adding both to the variation of the sound and the feel of the groove. I am pretty pleased with the result.

The 606 hats emulation is really really, really tricky, so I kind of gave up and settled for something slightly different. This ended up a good decision for now, as it is the dub like metal chord sound running through the Space Echo that was I settled on.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload.

Oh, and finally a sorry to my partner Lucia who waited patiently thinking I was spending the evening with her, when I basically ignored her all night playing on my Nord. 

Sorry xx :)
