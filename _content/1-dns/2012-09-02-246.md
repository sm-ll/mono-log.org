Some metalic, silver box sounding grooves for tonights upload, coming probably as a result of todays looking at lots of pretty silver boxes on E-Bay. :)

Although, form all that looking a new piece of equipment is hopefully arriving in my studio soon. It's an upgrade from an old piece of gear that I sold many years ago and regretted, and will be happy to replace. Actually there are a few pieces where this is the case, however, one step at a time. I would say what it is but I am concerned to jinx my bidding.

Obviously whatever I buy I wont be able to include it in these uploads, but I will however be adding some new bits to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/moize" title="Soundcloud" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a>, so I will keep you all posted.

Until then enjoy the dubby silverbox-like groove for tonight.
