More experimenting in the Korg Volca Sample Sequencer. I am using the 101 to control the speed of the Volca Sample, so the tempo can be much much lower, allowing more cycles of the perceived loop in one sequence, save me using extra sequences for variation. Seems to work ok-ish.

Very Jan Jelinek this upload, which the Korg Volca Sample seems to oozeâ€¦very difficult not to do that actually, which is a good thing in my book.

Enjoy.
