A slightly late post today, apologies for this, me and Lucia have been out most of the day in preparation for our performance this evening at <a href="http://www.theagencygallery.co.uk/" title="The Agency Gallery" target="_blank">The Agency Gallery</a> in south London.

Due to this and the late hour, and feeling pretty shattered, I have created something quickly using the looper patch I made using delayed logic modules, something I have been meaning to do for a while. I used this chance to make a scratching, melodic, noticeable loop. No sequencers where used in this, just me playing some simple notes on the keyboard and it playing them back. It is slightly different to working with a audio looper or looper pedal, in that in loops the midi data, so it really depends on how you patch it, how it loops. Obviously the means potentially you can loop any midi data, something I should probably explore more in the future.

Its a bit of a quick job, but I think the speed has brought in some nice roughness to the sound. I hope you enjoy tonights upload.
