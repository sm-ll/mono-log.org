Todays upload comes with its own mp3 conversion artefact as a result of the conversion interfering with those extreme frequencies. I have noticed this many times before in these daily uploads but for the most part have either been able to live with them, or they actually sometimes add a nice texture. I have always found them to be most audible where using a combination of high with low frequencies. 


Todays is perhaps the heaviest example of these mp3 conversion artefacts and the come in the form of the whooshing sound you can hear that changes in pitch along with the increases in bass frequencies. I was tempted to increase the conversion rate, but felt I would leave this in, just to show as an example of the mp3 format and its floors.

Admittedly all the conversion have been done at 192kbps in joint stereo, and so not the highest conversion rate, but for the most part an acceptable one for online audio and for streaming speed. However, what with many of us being exposed to sound in an iPod era, I alway believe this uncertainty of accurate audio replication, is one good reason at least to not use the iPod for proper listening at home and prefer the cd player.
