A <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_316/" title="few posts ago">few posts ago</a> I mentioned I might get a new piece of equipment, well today it arrived, and very nice it sounds too.

For anyone wishing to get a cheap, nice looking and well built pedal, the MXR's seem very nice, very pleased with it. For sure, I would still love the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase, but I have my eye on something else on e-Bay at the moment ;)

Tonights upload was a bit of a challenge, a complex and rough pattern that just took some time to behave. I have tried experimenting again with more ideas using the previous shifting patch I created a few posts ago, and obviously the new MXR Phase 90 pedal. I have also made a few subtle changes to the wiring of the studio for a bit more flexibility. The result is a slow, gritty dub texture pattern with subtle rhythmical pokk sounds.

I realise more and more that the use of effects have been creeping in to these uploads for what began as a pure Nord Modular sound, however, this project was always about a creative process, and to serve as a starting point. Presently I am just doing what feels right, and with new toys sat on my table staring at me each nightâ€¦well it just feels right to use them :)

I am also itching to use some of my other equipment, like my loved yet neglected Akai 2800, my new TR-606, or even the Nord Rack 2, a synth I used a huge amount back in my mid 20's, but rarely since. It is a shame, and although it is partly because it has seen better days, it does sound pretty amazing even with these problems. I should turn it on again.

Maybe this weekend I will do just that.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the crumbling sound that is tonights upload, and thanks again for all the support and feedback, it is all greatly appreciated.
