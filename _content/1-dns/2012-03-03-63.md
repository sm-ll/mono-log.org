More sound reworks today from <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_55/" title="last weeks upload" target="_blank">last weeks upload</a>, this version being a far more agressive and energetic take, perhaps more tone than pulse but still using a slight jam/live feel to its delivery as the initial version had.

I feel this sort of sound shares more in common with when I wrote Techno than with the more ambient or electronic styles. It has a drive, repetition and groove that feels all Techno for me and I certainly feel it has a great deal in common with Techno in the 'way' it is written also, using a balancing of the sounds to deliver new takes on essentially the same groove.

It seems that no matter how many years pass that Techno seed of repetition, grooves, and sound production techniques is never far away, this is certainly something that pleases me. I keep threatening to make Techno again one day, and one day I will :)
