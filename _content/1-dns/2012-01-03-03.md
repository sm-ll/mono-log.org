Upon removing my earplugs after waking up this morning, before even leaving our bed I could already sense the storming dark skies peering down on me…I noticed the window in our studio was ever so slightly open, and after a restless night it finally came to me what I would work on this morning using my Nord Modular.

While making my morning coffee, I turned on my equipment and then set up the Sony recorder placing it on the window sill and opened the window a little more. Immediately I experienced how loud the noise from outside really was. It was almost threatening as it played with small drink cans and other objects across the ground, the distant planes barely audible over its din, all to almost demonstrate how small and powerless we really are.

I think this is the first time in perhaps four years that I have again experienced how the wind can be so haunting during the early hours of the morning before the sun has had a chance to rise, and this thought took me back to years past reminding me of early morning walks with my dog and returning home to a warm flat, the smell of both fresh morning coffee and toast still lingering.

I sat on our window-sill for a while, the window slightly ajar, just listening…sipping the first fresh coffee of the day and watching the early risers rushing about in their kitchens getting ready for their day, and briskly walking the streets of north London, huddled deep down inside their hooded coats. The dogs seemed quiet today, perhaps they too were marvelling at the exciting combination of a dark morning and windy skies.
