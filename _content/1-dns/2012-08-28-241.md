Some klonk sounding grooves for tonights upload, a creation come after listening to some early Plastikman albums while working this evening.

In this sketch I wanted to experiment with space between sounds a little more but this time using a tailing off noise sound just to fill out the groove that little bit more. With this sound this seem a little more groove like but still in keeping with the stuttering in the start stop motion that I am enjoying so much.

I have to say I quite enjoyed creating tonights sounds, an experiment that came together very quickly, I wish this was always the case. 

The quickness was partly due being based loosely on the previously programmed TR909 and TR606 patches that I tweaked. Although generally speaking I like to create something new each time, sometimes it just make sense to re-use certain bits, either to help with focus or speed, or a particular sound I am wanting to start from. 

It certainly changes the feel of making something with the Nord if re-using patches, insisting a sort of memory to past creations also fuelling the new, quite a nice experience really.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this one.
