Some more texture and tone ideas inspired by one of my all time favourite albums <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Stephan-Mathieu-Full-Swing-Edits/release/155205" title="Full Swing Edits." target="_blank">Full Swing Edits.</a>

I have been wanting to do an album or release at least that is in mind of this great release and through these uploads are ever closer in having the material to do so. This is very exciting I feel.

Certainly after a weekend of relaxing and thinking about future plans, I am very eager for the next week to begin and even more eager for October to begin, being the month I will be officially starting on my label Sm-ll, for a January 1st launch.

I have some very exciting plans for Sm-ll, not only for it being a record label, but the beginnings of an idea to help combat piracy on the internet. I am not going to say much more about it now, but I have a good feeling this could actually be the answer to small labels and their problems. Still, we will see, I need to do some tests myself and want to try these out on my own label first, before helping others. If it works, which I feel it will, well, it could be a very exciting year in 2013.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload, and if you haven't done so already, do get yourself a copy of Full Swing Edits, is amazing.
