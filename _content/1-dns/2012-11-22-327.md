I think its fair to say this is by far the nearest to techno these uploads have come thus far, although the murky dub sound still present

While working on this upload it reminded me again of the difficulty I have often found in trying to work towards more typical EQ choices on tracks. I am sure this is something many people find when working on something, comparing theirs to someone they admire for this reason.

Personally I have always preferred working in that murky area of sound, although generally happy with this, on occasion I have a slight concern, but know there is little I can do about it. It is 'my sound' as they say, and I have always believed in balancing sounds just as might in the same experimental way as the sounds and structure themselves.

Perhaps when listening to my own creations, thoughts about my EQ choices compared to someone else is still more a subjective thing, and I really just need to hear someone else sounds with their own ears, to find they too have these same thoughts, I am sure.

When thinking of how I imagine sounds and how they should be presented, I have often used the analogy of thinking as tracks or sounds as blocks. A track as a block, a mass of solid sound, each might be carved slightly different from one to the next, but essentially each is a block. I like things to have little structure, or structural vigour. Some might say, boring even…although it is often those things that are full to the brim that I find boring. 

A block of grey, perhaps fading to a lighter grey, fuzzy around the edges, blurred…I think I like that :)

I hope you enjoy tonights upload, and some rambling from me, I think its been a while.
