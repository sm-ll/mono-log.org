I am not using the Inkel built in delay for todays upload, very tempted mind you, but obviously being a new mixer the Nord Modular is now running through it, and so I have been making good use of its nice EQ capabilities to help balance things.

I have obviously been as restraint as I can be, and have used the EQ much in the same as I would have with the previous mixer.

I have to say although I haven't had much chance to play about with the Inkel today, it has already inspired a new studio arrangement that has been needed for sometime.

I am very happy with the new arrangement and even happier with the new addition to it. I will post up a picture soon.

I hope you enjoy the sketch for today.
