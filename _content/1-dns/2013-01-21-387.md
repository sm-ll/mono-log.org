A good coffee, a really good coffee, doesn't need milk. Its sweet, mouth watering, and black.

Often people say they like milk in their coffee, milk is only put in coffee when the coffee is no good, it needs the milk, the sweetness of milk to disguise such a bitter and floored tasteless commercial muck. This muck comes in gallon size containers, fully dressed up in some white frothy coat, allowing it to sneak into peoples lives, like a private investigator, rubbish at their job. A cool trench coat and a snazzy hat, just don't cut it.

Milk in coffee, is like using reverb or delay on a poor track. It doesn't make it good, it just makes it milky. A good track doesn't need milk, it sounds great straight and black, its sweet enough.

However, a good reverb, a good delay, can stand on it own as a very tasty drink.
