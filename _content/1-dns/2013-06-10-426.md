See the breaking glass. In the underpass. See the breaking glass. In the underpass. Warm leatherette.
<br /><br />
Hear the crushing steel. Feel the steering wheel. Hear the crushing steel. Feel the steering wheel.
<br /><br />
Warm leatherette. Warm leatherette.
<br /><br />
Warm leatherette. Melts on your burning flesh. You can see your reflection. In the luminescent dash. Warm leatherette.
<br /><br />
A tear of petrol. Is in your eye. The hand brake. Penetrates your thigh. Quick - Let's make love. Before you die.
<br /><br />
On warm leatherette. Warm leatherette.
<br /><br />
Warm leatherette. Warm leatherette. Warm leatherette.
<br /><br />
Join the car crash set.
