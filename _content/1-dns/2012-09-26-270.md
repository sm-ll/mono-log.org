Some extreme pulse exploration for tonights upload, please be careful with your ears.

I wanted to do something very simple and using as few modules as possible, yet be able to produce complex and shifting patterns.

These sort of sounds are probably not to the enjoyment of most people, but I quite enjoy creating them. They seem to create a mood that I like both through its sense of displacement and unusual in nature.

I think I have got this style better in previous uploads, but I hope its an interesting listen all the same.
