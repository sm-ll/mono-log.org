A difficult time this evening with experimentation and it not giving back what I wanted a bit disappointing but still, this is how it goes sometimes. 

What I have ended up with is a kind of quiet but noisy texture that was created by balancing 2 sines tones on the cusp of high resonance filters, with additional filters to balance things out. I made some live adjusts, but nothing major.

It does create further difficulty when aiming for something, not getting it, and being instead presented with something entirely different, and then having to be positive about it, hearing it for what it is.

Still, I think it is an interesting process, even if a little frustrating on my part, but something that I imagine many of you have experienced at some point or another.

What does occur is the similarity to perhaps some of the earlier uploads I made that emulated the noises around our studio or outside, and yet 126 uploads on and my desire has perhaps changed more than I have realised. 

Perhaps tomorrow things will sound different, they generally do.

I hope you can hear something interesting in tonights upload, even if I am struggling :)
