Another sound for our Canada work, this one actually reminding me of an artist that I am a huge fan of and had almost entirely forgot about rather ironically, and that is <a href="http://www.lissongallery.com/#/artists/ceal-floyer/" title="Ceal Floyer">Ceal Floyer</a>.

I have included an image of one of her works, called 'Title Variable: 3M 86.5 CM, 2001 - 2002', borrowed from <a href="http://www.museomadre.it/opere.cfm?id=272" title="The Museo d’Arte Contemporanea Donna Regina">The Museo d’Arte Contemporanea Donna Regina</a> website, whereby you can read more about her work, which I highly recommend doing, along with <a href="http://www.lissongallery.com/#/artists/ceal-floyer/" title="Lisson Galleries website.">Lisson Galleries website.</a>
