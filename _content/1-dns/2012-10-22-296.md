A little play with some of the fx's in todays Nord Modular upload. 

Again I have left the Nord to play on its own at the beginning and the end, and added some Inkel delay and Space Echo for a bit of fun.

This is just a quirky little murky sketch, and mainly an experiment in exploring the textures and noises in my new equipment. I have been itching to experiment with the Inkel and Space Echo, but really as of yet have only been able to within the daily uploads, which as you know if you have been following hasn't included many.

I also thought considering today begun rather murky here in London,a murky photo I took this morning seemed fitting.

I hope you enjoy.
