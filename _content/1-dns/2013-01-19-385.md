I imagine a club, and in that club it challenges the very idea of what a club can be. It delivers a unique sound that fits somewhere between the best minimal sounds of Richard Chartier and Plastikman. 

I imagine a sound that uses the delivery of frequencies to create a sound that uses itself to create a blanket or platform of sound for which less sounds can fit above. A sound that absorbs all the scuffles and shuffles of people, to provide emptiness for which sounds can happily nestle on top. 

I imagine the culture and people of this club will have their behaviour traits challenged, they will not feel they can dance, and so will have to explore bodily movements in other ways, pure and dedicated expressions of movement. 

I imagine it to be a new place, that progresses both club culture and the music surrounding it.

We cannot afford to sit still and create safe worlds for which to potter about it. We have to constantly look ahead, develop, and inspire.
