It’s funny how coincidence works. I was looking for something interesting to post along with my sound upload for today, and initially decided I would use this wonderful photo my partner took a while back on our visit to the site formerly known as the Commonwealth Institute, in London. I ended up deciding against it as not really relevant, and wanted to use it at some point more creatively for a future post, I decided instead to include a quote from William I. Thomas, that I first enjoyed when cited by Erving Goffman in his book ‘Presentation of Self in Everyday Life’.

In this quote there is the mention and usage of spoons to explain inference in social encounters. I thought it would be apt to included a picture of some spoons, and immediately thought of the spoons designed by the excellent architect John Pawson, that I first saw at his exhibition held at the London Design Museum. After failing to find a good image, I decided to visit John Pawson’s website, as it has been a while. 

After opening of the site I was greeted with a very similar image of what appeared to be of the same ceiling in my partners photo, that of the Commonwealth Institue…?? After some thought I remembered our reason for being at the Commonwealth Institute was after our learning of <a href="http://www.johnpawson.com/" title="John Pawson">John Pawson</a> being asked to assist in the designing of a new London Design Museum, that is to be relocated in this wonderful and previously unused building, a discovery that had entirely slipped my mind. 

The issue of what ‘exactly’ to put as my post, however, beyond this rambling now, is still somewhat undecided, so I think I will return to the spoons that somewhat started it all, but perhaps leave the quote for tomorrow.
