Some more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TB-303" title="TB303" target="_blank">TB303</a> emulation development for tonights upload, with most of the little silver boxe's sound working quite well in this patch. Although I yet to get that classic slide working well enough, I will hopefully get that nailed tomorrow or sometime soon.

As many of the recent uploads have, this one also falls closest to my project as Pokk!, my dub-techno alias. This one using the standard TB303 waveform options, a combination of the square waveform mainly with a little support from the saw. The hat sounds are based around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-606" title="TR606" target="_blank">TR606</a>, that more metalic sound I have always enjoyed, and finally the kick drum a combination of simple oscillator and envelope modules.

I have to say I have been really enjoying working with the Nord Modular these last handful of days, and I really hope this continues.

I hope you enjoy this one.

Ohâ€¦the picture is of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET" title="Commodore Pet Computer" target="_blank">Commodore Pet Computer</a>, which has nothing to do with this post, but while looking for a suitable image I stumbled across this and simply thought it was beautiful. I can't believe I have never seen one before and so had to share it with you. I wish they made them like this still today.
