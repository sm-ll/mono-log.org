A late post today, and so I will make this quick and just simply say these sounds are played from my controller keyboard after some inspiration from a recent and new experience for me of the mind and sounds of Brian Eno, someone I can't say I have ever really followed or listened to. All I can hear in my mind right now is the saying “what you resist, will persist”. :) 

I will write about these experiences another day and how much me and Brian Eno seem to share…I was a Postman once too Brian, for almost 10 years actually :)

Enjoy tonights glassy tones.
