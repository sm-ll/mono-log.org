I am becoming quite excited by the prospect of what to do with all these sounds come the end of the year, and am thinking for the first time about this a little more. I have a few ideas but for the most part am still undecided. 

One possible idea that does get me excited is that of bringing together other people who also use the Nord Modular, to perhaps work on something together or have them rework some patches into a more finished and personal take.

As is sometimes the case in projects involving many people or many techniques, the sounds can be radically transformed beyond recognition, and although not necessarily a bad thing, I think in this case it would be great to keep the Nord as a main focus or tool, ensuring sounds do not travel to far away from that Nord sound and yet is explored and pushed in different directions by its user. Hopefully more on this in the future.

Todays upload is a combination of other techniques explored and is essentially a tone patch running through two granular patch, and a final fourth patch for texture and higher frequencies. I think with the exception of the very first upload, this is the only other upload that uses all four patches combined, and perhaps I might do more of this in the future.

Finally, I am beginning to feel more at home with the Nord Modular than I have before, and it reminds me a little like using an older piece of kit, much like my old Juno 60 did or my Tr-606 had done before I unfortunately sold them onâ€¦sigh.

Enjoy todays sound.
