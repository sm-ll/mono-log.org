Todays upload is a challenging one I feel, and although perhaps this will change the more I hear it, part of the reason is I have been experimenting with the Logic modules in the Nord Modular again today.

To explain, the logic modules basically decide when to send a trigger, a trigger being something that could be used to trigger a sound for example. This trigger is sent by comparing to incoming numbers, if a number is greater or equal to the other number then a trigger is sent. This sort of module comes is really handy when using waveforms to output the numbers, creating repetitive patterns of triggers all synced and obviously looped to the controlling waveform. I find this a much more interesting way of creating patterns of sound than what can be achieved with some of the sequence modules within the Nord Modular.

Although todays sound is a little bit chaotic and unusual, I have done my best in the time I give myself to make something worthy of uploading, although I am very keen to work more with the logic modules and am very much looking forward to tomorrow and creating some interesting phasing sounds.

A bit of a different sound for today, but hopefully one that can be a worthy mark for what has already become the 100th upload.
