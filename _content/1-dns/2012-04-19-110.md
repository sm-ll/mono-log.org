Tonights upload came as a bit of a surprise. 

After a long day of working on new features for this blog, I headed to the Nord once again to hear the sound that it is always playing when I turn it on. Generally when I hear this sound I immediately think of where it was originally going to be used, and why it eventually wasn't used. I think of the people involved in that project this sound belonged to and wonder to myself what those people might be doing today. 

This sound has taken on something of a history for myself only, stimulating all manor of fleeting thoughts racing through my mind, unable to stop it in its track as it would normally be focused on the making of a new sound. Yet today this sound caught my attention a little more than usual.

I can't say it is a good sound, nor can I say the sound I have uploaded today ressembles it. Through my tweaks and modifications, I find myself in a moment of confusion, lost in the world this sound was placed, and yet available to me the core ingredients with which to change it, as if almost digging into history itself.

The sound that I am uploading today, perhaps then stands as something else, borrowing from history perhaps, and yet maybe not with the impact the original sound seems to have. Perhaps I should save todays sound as the one I hear when I turn on my Nord. My Nord seems to have a shifting personality, a character that seems to change as each new sound takes hold.

While playing with todays sound, I am reminded of the beautiful simplicity of <a href="http://westernvinyl.com/artists/julius.html" title="Rolf Julius">Rolf Julius</a>, <a href="http://www.rienakajima.com/" title="Rie Nakajima">Rie Nakajima</a>, <a href="http://www.mikiyui.com/" title="Miki Yui">Miki Yui</a>, and <a href="http://www.weeld.net/colourofquantum.html" title="Lucia H Chung's">Lucia H Chung's</a> wonderful sounds, that all seem to reveal more and more with each passing of time, and feel pleased and lucky to have experienced such incredible work.
