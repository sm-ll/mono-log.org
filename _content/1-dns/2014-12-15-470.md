So after enjoying the jamming of Voodoo Ray with upload SND468, I figured what with all the TR707 interest of late due to Roland releasing an upgrade for their new TR-8, I would have some more fun with the album that always comes to mind when I hear the Roland TR707, and that is Weirs by Luke Vibert and Jeremy Simmonds.

This album has been played many times, and this track specifically has one of the best SH101 baselines, so simple, so square, so 101.

Enjoy.
