### New website.
So firstly I want to apologise for the delay in getting this upload to you, but it has been for the reason of getting the new website/blog ready. What do you think?

I will be working on a few other features as and when I get the chance, hopefully a random player to pick for the uploads might be nice, and perhaps a more useful category or tagging system.

The last few weeks and basically been almost non-stop, which is good, but while I write this Sunday night, well actually Monday morning, I am feeling I need a weekend off. Still, if I can keep bringing new and better things to share then its all worth it.

You might have noticed there is no commenting on this blog, and after giving it some thought I decided not to have it after all.  Obviously feel free to message me on my Facebook wall.

### The upload.

The first of tonights uploads comes as a rough, dubbed out grooves from brother and sister of the Roland family, yep, the TR-606 and TB-303. There might have been some fx floating about too.

I did this on a different set of headphones, and so it might sound a little different.
