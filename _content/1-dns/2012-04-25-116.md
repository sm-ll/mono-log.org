More dubby chords and resonant textures for tonights upload.

I wanted to create something that had that typical resonant and gritty chord sound I love so much in techno dub music, and felt the Nord Modular could perhaps get ever closer with still no external fxâ€¦I wasn't disappointed.

I feel tonights upload shares a lot with some more experimental uploads of the past, with the repetition of subtle movement and an almost agressive energy, yet seeming still and simplistic. I am forever stunned by what this synth can do as it continues to inspire me, and all the while a joy to use.

It is a quick post this evening, as I am going to spend the evening with someone special.

I hope you enjoy this murky resonant chord texture.
