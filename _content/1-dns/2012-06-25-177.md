Sorry for the slight lateness of todays upload, I will try to get the back on track. 

As often the case when Lucia is away, my sleep pattern goes all over the place. I end up working into the early hours, although I really shouldn't. I have to say though I have been enjoying the quiet of London at night, and also creating sounds in the early hours has a definite mood to it. I am not entirely sure what to make of the results sometimes, as I am a bit dazed after a long day, but it certainly produces some interesting collisions of sound.

This upload, I began with different intentions, and as is often the case with modular creating, when you want to change, the chance can produce a spaghetti of cables. I am sure all of you who use anything with multiple connections are familiar with this.

I think this upload has something in there even if I haven't quite worked out what it is yet, maybe you know?

I hope you enjoy it.
