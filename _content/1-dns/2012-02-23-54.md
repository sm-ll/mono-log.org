Todays upload takes me back to the incredible release <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Stephan-Mathieu-Full-Swing-Edits/release/155205" title="Full Swing Edits by Stephan Mathieu">Full Swing Edits by Stephan Mathieu</a>. Full Swing Edits is one of my all time favourite releases and one that is listened to on a regular basis, normally found sitting on top of my CD player, as it is now. This album was one of the first cd's I bought from the now sadly defunct <a href="http://www.smallfish.co.uk/" title="Smallfish Records">Smallfish Records</a> shop in Old Street area, London. The other album was <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/every_action/" title="Every Action by Motion, on 12k">Every Action by Motion, on 12k</a>, another amazing work, by an artist who has also seemingly disappeared.

It is these albums that remind me of my visits to the Smallfish Record shop, and from its demise comes as a symbol in my mind, enforcing what I have always believed, which is that everyone has a responsibility in what and how we contribue to this music. 

The presence of such a knowledgable and friendly shop was hugely influential for many people such as myself, and with such unique experiences to be had visiting such a shop, is one example of how individuals and their passions and experience can influence and educate new generations in dramatic ways.

With this in mind, I think in addition to making music, we should think carefully about our actions in how our music is heard, where it is heard, how we distribute it, how much it should cost, if it should be free, and ultimately what affect these decisions might have on the future of this music, and not just ourselves. 

I believe with the advent of the internet, now is the time more than ever when a responsibility of such things is essential, a responsibility falling on the shoulders of us all. We must all be in conversation with what we are contributing to, and consider what 'we' can do to contribute and shape a largely unforeseen and possible unstable future of this music.
