It is surprising how history can creep up without any expectation of it. 

While creating todays upload I was suddenly struck by how similar it had become to a sound in a previous performance me and my partner did as <a href="http://www.mimosamoize.com/" title="mimosa|moize">mimosa|moize</a> back in <a href="http://www.cafeoto.co.uk/WORLDLISTENINGPREVIEW.shtm" title="2010 at Cafe Oto">2010 at Cafe Oto</a>.

The evening at Cafe Oto was in collaboration with our good friend Aleksandra Borys, who provided an incredible performance of minimal movements. It is times like this when thinking back to previous work, while in preparation of new work, that an surprising collection of similarities emerge.

It might seem kind of obvious there will be these similarities occurring in our work, and I would have to agree, but what is the surprising part is how they seem to pop up when we least expect it, and how that in this new context, the context of today, things that were once understood in one way, are suddenly thrown into a new understanding, given a new perspective.

I can't help also notice some similarities in todays sound to that of our friend <a href="http://www.yannnovak.com/" title="Yann Novak's">Yann Novak's</a> work or perhaps more specifically, the image, or sound, I have in my mind when I think of Yann and his label <a href="http://www.dragonseyerecordings.com/" title="Dragon's Eye Recordings">Dragon's Eye Recordings</a>. Todays sound also reminds me of another day back in 2010, when meeting Yann and experiencing his installation work for the first time in person, a work entitled <a href="http://www.yannnovak.com/works/stillness/" title="Stillness">Stillness.</a>

Although todays sound was not made initially as a homage to Yann and his work, I think that is what I will present it as, along with an image I quickly made as a reference to that day in 2010. 

Ironically this sound will be used in part for our approaching performance in Canada, a week that will reunite me and my partner with Yann and friends for the first time since.
