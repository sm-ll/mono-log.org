Yesterday me and my partner <a href="http://www.weeld.net/colourofquantum.html" title="Lucia" target="_blank">Lucia</a> had the pleasure of meeting up with <a href="http://recordedfields.net/" title="Robert Curgenven" target="_blank">Robert Curgenven</a>, who dodged the rain and popped round for coffee, chat/rant, and to kindly drop of his latest releases, the much anticipated collaboration with <a href="http://www.lineimprint.com/editions/cd/line_056/" title="Richard Chartier entitled Built Through, a release on Line" target="_blank">Richard Chartier entitled <i>Built Through</i>, a release on Line</a>, and another work I have been very excited by, this time <a href="http://windsmeasurerecordings.net/catalog/wm25/" title="released on Winds Measure Recordings" target="_blank">released on Winds Measure Recordings</a> as a 12", a split release with <a href="http://selvageflame.com/" title="Will Montgomery" target="_blank">Will Montgomery</a>.

Yesterday evening was clear from midday, obviously being one of listening to our new goodies. I have yet to listen to the 12", but did listen to the Curgenven/Chartier collaboration, which uses whole tracks from Chartiers previous and earliest releases on Line (and I have to say some of my favourite), Series and Of Surfaces.

I did also realise for the first time, Richard Chartiers first Line release being called Series, and my conceptual 12" releases to come out on Sm-ll also under Series. I imagine it was in my sub-concious, although I am very bad with titles, but think sharing the same title it is more than fitting coincidence, the name stays for certain.

Anyway…me and Lucia also sat and listened to the original works that are used by Robert in <a href="http://www.lineimprint.com/editions/cd/line_056/" title="Built Through" target="_blank">Built Through</a>, and we also talked slightly about issues I mentioned in <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_136/" title="yesterdays post" target="_blank">yesterdays post</a>, about how artists change over the years.

I am not writing a review of the release, but did think it is an excellent release and a well constructed album and for the most part really does sound much like I expected form a Robert Curgenven and Richard Chartier collaboration. I hope they do another one, and hope the material falls at Richards feet last the next time, it would be great to hear Richar remove much of Roberts sound, a harnessing of what I always feel is a edgy and instable perceived sound of Robert. 

Think about this, I do wonder if this would be Richard Chartiers approach at all, and from what I hear from his work more recently, I can't help but wonder about the thoughts of yesterdays post, in how much has his world and sound been affecting by what I feel is a very different music world. 

Modern day seems frantic, urgent, and with a unprecedented amount of information circling us all day and everyday. I wonder does this insist a stricter or further reduction process, or does it actually encourage some to turn themselves up, not just sonically but more metaphorically?

For me I still prefer that raw, edgy and simplistic sound that often comes at the beginnings of adventures, ideas or movements. The time where things seem to want to deliver something that can best encapsulate what it is people are trying to grapple with. Attempts at pinning ideas down can deliver the most surprising and interesting results and for me, this is what excites me more.

Today's upload has undoubtably been influenced by last nights listen session, and so is a sort of combination of more minmal style more than minimalistic in sound, and also the sound of perhaps some previous uploads. A balance of texture, pulses and bass…its perhaps too complex for my liking, but not wishing to make a track/performance out of it, all sounds are on top of each other.

I hope you enjoy todays upload, and I will leave you with the simplest yet most concise description ever printed for a release.
