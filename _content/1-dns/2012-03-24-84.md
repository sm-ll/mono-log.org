Todays upload is a variation on <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_83/" title="yesterdays sound" target="_blank">yesterdays sound</a>, (which I accidentally and annoyingly copied over) with this version instead exploring the more subtle textures that become apparent when working with bass frequencies within the Nord Modular, and in particular the hiss and whine that comes through from certain processes.

I should warn that the bass is quite low and heavy and so recommend either low listening volumes in a quiet room or more ideally some good quality headphones. Headphones is what I normally use when creating each sound.

Finally, if anyone would like to send me anything that might inspire me in a particular way, a photograph, a sound, direction, limitationâ€¦anything really, please feel free, as this would really be great. Equally if anyone has any suggestions they would like to share, I would love to hear them.

Enjoy todays sound.
