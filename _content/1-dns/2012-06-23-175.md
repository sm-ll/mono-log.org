I have been quite busy the last few days, working on various websites, and a new web based project of mine that I am quite excited about, although more about that another time. 

Evidently this new project has been occupying most of my mind, and making the switch to suddenly create sounds again, can be rather a tricky one. 

I have something of a love hate relationship with these sorts of situations, in that it is really difficult to be able to concentrate equally on a multiple of tasks. As one thing moves to the front of the mind, its natural for those other things to move slightly back.

As a result I feel todays upload is playing it safe a little, which is by no means a bad thing at all, and good sounds don't exist by just being challenging, but generally I have been always trying to push it in various ways with each of the uploads and tonights I could tell my mind was elsewhere.

Still I like the upload, it is everyday for a whole year, and this is the nature of what its all about. I am slightly surprised how o.k. I am about itâ€¦hmm, I guess my perspective is changing after all, about time. :)

As always I hope you enjoy the upload.
