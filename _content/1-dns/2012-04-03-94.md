For todays upload I wanted to create something that I have been itching to try since the beginning of these uploads, and that is something with a dub influence.

I have always used my Nord Rack in the past for creating Dub-like sounds, but have always used it very much as a starting point for much computer processing to follow. Generally speaking, something of the key elements of creating something dub-like are missing from the Nord Modular, but mainly the major missing part is delay, lots and lots of delay.

I initially set out to create a delay line in the Modular, but very quickly iI went the wrong way with the patch, and not wanting to start all over again I decided to experiment with what I had and see where it put me. I can't say it is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN56-TCaoEQ" title="what I had in mind" target="_blank">what I had in mind</a>, with this upload having more a 'nice' feel to it, but none the less, I found it an interesting and helpful experiment. 

I have a feeling subsequent attempts might be more fruitful, with this sound having perhaps the potential to be sampled and reused, or equally to be thought of as a sort of filler to something more darker or richer to followâ€¦I guess time will tell.

It is something a little different, but I hope you can enjoy it all the same.
