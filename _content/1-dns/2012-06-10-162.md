After what seemed like an ever growing building wall of frustration, I have reminded myself of my search of the key components that allow me creative focus, freedom and also the strong structure that allows me this, and of course some relief of temporary insanity.

Todays upload then, comes as No.1 of a catalogue of components that I will upload each day. A creative exercise, building of context and subsequent handy reference for myself. I am going to use specific component is tracks by artists and use these as my building blocks.

Component #1, is in reference to Richard Chartier's Filer track on the Mille Plateaux compilation <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Various-Clicks-Cuts-2/release/6185" title="Clicks & Cuts Volume 2" target="_blank">Clicks & Cuts Volume 2</a>. The relatively 'track' like qualities that I perhaps wonder the compilation format brought to the front of Richards output, and otherwise more challenging sound. Also the volume by comparison is much louder, and the palette of sound one that really explores different sounds at different frequencies and pitchesâ€¦my cup of tea.

I hope you enjoy todays upload.
