Firstly apologies for this hasty post and any clunky sentences, I am going away today and am rushing to leave, but will be back tomorrow and should be uploading as normal.

Recently I have been introduced to the fine DJ <a href="http://www.discogs.com/user/djfothotmail.com" title="Finn Albertsson" target="_blank">Finn Albertsson</a>, resident at <a href="http://www.culture-box.dk/" title="The Cultrue Box in Copenhagen" target="_blank">The Cultrue Box in Copenhagen</a>.

I have been lucky to hear his amazing set of 5 Hours with Finn Albertsson, and what a collection of music there is. A beautiful journey through some amazing dub/electronic and ambient soundscapes, opening with a firm favourite of mine <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Fires-Of-Ork-The-Fires-Of-Ork/master/21694" title="Pete Namlook and Geir Jenssen together as Fires Of Ork" target="_blank">Pete Namlook and Geir Jenssen together as Fires Of Ork</a>. 

I wont list the artists here but suffice to say Finn Albertsson is one person who I would certainly watch DJ, I am just keeping my fingers crossed he comes to London sometime soon.

Todays upload has taken the form of of the sounds and moods presented to me while listening to Finn's set. It is a slow, and simple repetitive fluctuation of tones that seemed to have naturally slotted into this mood. I wasn't intending on doing this, and wasn't sure what to do actually, but went with what I felt at the time, and in the haste of getting ready to leave the result is what you hear today…and I am certainly feeling this one. 

The dub influence is very very subtle, but it is in there through the subtle beating of the tones. This reminds me yet again to revisit my dub project Pokk!…I must do this sometime soon, very soon actually. It has been too long I have been holding off with this project, and if I was a man who took heed of signs, which I am, Finn Albertsson is a pretty big sign :D

Enjoy todays upload.
