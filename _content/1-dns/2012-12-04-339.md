For tonights upload I thought I would finally have a go at revisiting some old work of my from 1994, and perhaps this being some of my favourite work of all time.

One would think re-creating something would be a pretty easy enough task, well I have learnt today it is perhaps the hardest thing I have ever tried. So much so I actually gave in and made it something that had more in the way of the general feeling of the original, but a very different version.

I remembered the original not taking this many hours to create and probably sounds a lot better, but then perhaps nostalgia is playing a part here.

I am however, very glad I attempted this recreation, and will probably do some more in the future, especially now that I know it is pretty much impossible for me at least to recreate the magic of 94 perfectly. I could probably take the approach of more thinking back to how I might have though about sound and use this to create something new.

I hope you enjoy this upload, and obviously am aware many of you will be listening without knowing what the original sounds like, which is fine :)
