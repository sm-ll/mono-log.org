Many years ago I was lucky enough to be given a Kawai K1 as a gift from my brother. It was an amazing synth, and despite having to give it back a week later, I always remembering that machine having a certain quality to the sound that I loved, and only more recently realised a connection with certain music I also love.

It turns out that albums Frequencies by LFO, one of my all time favourites, and the Electro Soma by B12, another favourite, are both heavily using the Kawai K1. I would even go so far to say that that classic bass sound on LFO, is almost certainly coming from the Kawai K1.

Yesterday brought me and the K1 back together and boy does this thing sound incredible.

Lots of digital fuzz from the low bit rate. Very useable and simple editing. Small enough for the desktop, as I got the keyboardless K1m. And yet again I have something that looks like a fax machine to make music on.

Needless to say, a massively underated synth and if you can find one I recommend taking the plunge.
