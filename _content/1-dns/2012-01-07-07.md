One week of sounds and thoughts have passed and both have all turned to static it seems. My Saturday is filled with obligations and time, as always, is running faster than I would like. And so perhaps it is fitting that the sound which I am sharing today somehow reflects that fast paced life that so many of us find ourselves a member of, willing or not.

This does urge me to think of how sounds are also a reflection of our surroundings and our life style. How a city delivers to its inhabitants a certain requirement, an ideal, that is injected into almost everything we find we have some relation to. An opposite to the city, the country side perhaps also insists its residents urge a dialog with itself.

This is not to say though, that in either example of situation or place that either delivers an obvious creative output of relaxing sound or agitated sound. It draws me back to <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/1am/" title="Taylor Deupree’s release 1am">Taylor Deupree’s release 1am</a>, a CD that is perceived by far as his loudest and certainly most aggressive releases to date. This release was a direct response to the noise of insects perceived after moving to his new home in the woods of New York Stare and away from the noise of New York City. A new noise is found, one coming from the small and seemingly unnoticeable inhabitants, that of that the local countryside. “the midnight insects can be at once serene and deafeningly loud. A field recording of this din of nighttime creatures was the inspiration and base for 1am. Dense, and often aggressive, 1am” - <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/1am/" title="12k Website.">12k Website.</a>

This also brings me to my thoughts and experiences of moving to what initially seemed a quieter home, to only find amongst that quiet is a collection of sound that is both uncontrollable, disrespectful and as a result, all the more irritable. So is it to say that it is less the noise itself that is what makes it ‘noisy’ or not, but our relationship with it?

Finally, when thinking of relationships with sound, this always brings me back to love, and the thought that even the worst and most evil people on our planet are loved by someone.
