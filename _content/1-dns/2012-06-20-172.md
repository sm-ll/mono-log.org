I am very pleased with todays upload as I have finally managed to achieve the phasing of patterns that I have always wanted to create within the Nord Modular, and I managed to do it in one patch, which is just perfect for my OCD. At present I must be honest and have not entirely worked it out the patch enough to comfortably recreate variations of it, but its not overly complex, as this things tend to end up being, and so I am very much looking forward to picking it appart.

I have always liked this sort of phasing of sound ever since hearing <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Orbital-Orbital-2-Brown-Album/master/8943" title="Orbital" target="_blank">Orbital</a> use it in their second album (the brown one) obviously referencing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich" title="Steve Reich" target="_blank">Steve Reich</a>, someone whose work I enjoy very much and who I recently released was sampled by The Orb (who didn't they sample). I recognised the sample as I watched Steve Reich perform live recently at the Royal Albert Hall, realising I was kind of listening to The Orb live in a very odd way, it was an amazing performance all round.

I remember being quite the Orbital fan when very young, and probably being from England had something to do with this, but also the sparseness and dry quality to their sounds was always appealing by comparison to the overly heavy use of samples in much other work around at that time. Even during a time when not really following Orbitals work, <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Orbital-Snivilisation/master/22929" title="ironically from the point of their third album," target="_blank">ironically from the point of their third album,</a> I often went back to the first and last tracks on the brown one, to listen again to the shifting of sound, entirely captivated by something so simple yet so interesting. 

I often mention my project Pokk! on this blog, and if one thing can explain what Pokk! is, it would be this shifting or phasing of sound. An idea of shifts not only through sound arrangement or phasing, but through the perception of frequencies and the role these frequencies play in certain genres of music. These things are hugely influential to our perception of placement in pattern, and is what stands at the core of Pokk!

I hope you enjoy todays upload, personally I could listen to this sort of thing for quite a long time. There is always a sense of propulsion with this sort of sound, as one pattern ends another draws ever closer, like a speeding vehicle that is slightly too fast to jump from, leaving you tempted to leap but inevitably staying put.
