More swing experiments for tonights upload and further tests with the gap idea.

I am quite liking the gap being filled with atmospheric sounds, or dub-like textures, very quiet and distant. The gap doesn't have to be completely empty, and I suppose if only slightly there, and on occasion drifting away to almost nothing like it does tonight, it add something that fits in with cyclic sounds of much earlier uploads that I quite like.

I was reminded today of the classic album by <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Frank-Bretschneider-Taylor-Deupree-Balance/release/44993" title="Frank Bretschneider and Taylor Duepree titled Balance ">Frank Bretschneider and Taylor Duepree titled Balance </a> (thank you Andreas), which I believe I may have only mentioned once before on this blog, if at all actually.

This album was created some ten years ago, it is amazing how the time has moved past so quickly. Its a great listen and is created entirely through a process of Taylor and Frank swapping Nord Modular patches back and forth, a method I am very keen replicating in the future. If you haven't heard this album, change that now.

I have been thinking of something special to do for the last upload, and perhaps a re-working of something from Balance might be a good idea. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZrZzwz_blg" title="Concrete">Concrete</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbvtPShYH4c" title="Vertical Invader">Vertical Invader</a> are particularly tempting. 

What do you think?
