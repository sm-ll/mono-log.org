I am extremely excited by this upload, extremely excited.

I felt a bit tired this evening, so decided to knock off work early and do some research for todays upload. Not feeling in the mood for making music I thought I would see if there is any resources online of Roland TR-606 Dumatix Drum Machine emulations in the Nord Modular.

I typed in 'TR606 emulations for Nord Modular'.

Near the top of the list was this blog…hmm.

So I moved to google images, as I often do, to find if there was any diagrams of Nord Modular patches. I typed in my search again, and was shown lots of nice pictures of the TR606, and a few other…hang on a minute, those are my pictures…hmm

I decided to continue my search thinking to look for TR808, arguably the more popular Drum Machine, although the TR606 is by far the better machine to my mind and incidentally my favourite piece of equipment I have ever owed…and sold…twice…and now don't own…but thats another story which is far to depressing.

So I finally found some create resources online, at a few places. First up was good old Sound On Sound, the bible for some, the tea coaster for others.

<a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Jul02/articles/synthsecrets0702.asp" title="A July issue of Sound On Sound from 2002" target="_blank">A July issue of Sound On Sound from 2002</a> was talking about emulating cymbals, its looks quite good. Of course I didn't read it I was on a mission, but it did have some pretty pictures that worked well for me.

I learned about the 6 oscillator combination was key in creating the metal cymbal and hat sounds sounds for the TR808 and TR606, which was also confirmed here on <a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/A117_man.pdf" title="Doepfer's module" target="_blank">Doepfer's module</a>.

So I thought there must be a schematic for the TR606 somewhere online, and after a bit of rummaging thats exactly what I found at the <a href="http://machines.hyperreal.org/manufacturers/Roland/TR-606/schematics/roland.TR-606.schem-4.gif" title="great little website machines.hyperreal.org" target="_blank">great little website machines.hyperreal.org</a>. Amazing!

If your like me, schematics kinda of make sense, but I don't know many of the symbols, so you might like to use <a href="http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/symbol.htm" title="this website too." target="_blank">this website too.</a>

And as I have already mentioned I sold my TR606, twice…long story, I <a href="http://www.illuminatedsounds.com/?p=1420" title="found a handy sample pack online" target="_blank">found a handy sample pack online</a>, although I really don't think this is very accurate from my memory its a handy guidance.

So armed with my research I set about making the sounds. And sure enough it bloomin well worked :)

Amazing. I almost feel like I have my favourite silver buddy back in the studio.

I had to create three patches, one for the Bass Drum and Snare and Toms, one for the Hats, and one for a more Cymbal ased sound. As I say this is an emulation, so although I did keep checking back and forth, I was really more after the feel of the Roland TR606, as is always the case if I wanted the actual sound I would just go and buy one…well, I would buy one if they weren't almost 5 times the prices I bought mine for…anyway, live and learn. Although you would have thought I would have learned the first time…go figure.

So I thought I would knock up some dub flavoured grooves with my three new patches and after I think 5 attempts at this jam and almost breaking the recorder, I 'almost' nailed it. But in classic style I fluffed the last fade out of the hat sound. Its ironic as the TR606 had very small dials that were pretty stiff to turn, at least mine were. This was a good thing and allowed really nice fades etc if need, but if you wanted to quickly drop a sound out, especially the hats or cymbals, they always spilled if this was done on the machine volumes. My Nord has bigger dials but they are probably stiffer to turn, and so hearing this blunder at the end made my smile.

I know some of you are going to ask at some point in the future “can I have these patches”, well in this case I am more than happy to share these as there is no sketch of a track. However, I have provided all the resources in this post, so why not have a go yourself, seriously it isn't that hard and you get to hear a load of interesting sounds long the way, and learn a great deal…or at least I did. Which in my mind 'that' is what sharing is about, not take take take, but share the knowledge so you can make it even better and then share 'that' knowledge.

I can feel a piracy of music rant coming on so I will stop here, oh and the image for this post is not my own, it is taken from <a href="http://www.polyfon.dk/synth/tag/tr606/" title="polyfon.dk" target="_blank">polyfon.dk</a>, thank you, its a lovely image.

I hope you enjoy the upload as much as I did making it, I guess if you don't like the sound of the TR606 then perhaps you wont, or perhaps your'll find a new love for this wonderful machine…the best machine in my mind.

Thanks for listening.


### Additional Information edited on 05/07/2012. ###

You can view screen grabs of these patches at the following links. They are rough and have lots of room for improvement which I will do in time. However, if you should improve them yourself do let me know, it would be great to share :)

Roland TR606 BD, SD, LT & HT emulations.

Roland TR606 HATS. (I cheated/was lazy and so this is just a single patch not the proper HHC & HHO found on the 606.)

Roland TR606 CYMBAL. (This is similar to HATS, and the original TR606 used the same Oscillators with different filters, envelopes etc.)

Also here is the schematic for the sound in the Roland TR606, I found this really helpful, and so thought to link this here again at the bottom.
