Another reworking of a previous sound, this time of the melodic shifting sounds of last <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_54/" title="Thursdays upload" target="_blank">Thursdays upload</a>. This variation is perhaps slightly less melodic with a slightly more textured edgy shifting of tones.

Interestingly todays variations also shares some similarities to another track on the <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Stephan-Mathieu-Full-Swing-Edits/release/155205" title="Full Swing Edits">Full Swing Edits</a> album I mentioned in my post last week and equally reminds me of some of my own earlier work written around the time of Stephan's album, using another modular styled software called <a href="http://www.plogue.com/products/bidule/" title="Bidule" target="_blank">Bidule</a>.

Although Bidule is a modular software it differs from the Nord Modular in that it has no hardware, can use samples and processes of those samples, and in some ways is vastly more flexible than the Nord Modular, if that is of course something you are interested in. If you are keen on software such as Max, but are concerned it might take over your lifeâ€¦and it does, Bidule does well to bridge the gap from more easier software such as <a href="http://www.audiomulch.com/" title="Audiomulch">Audiomulch</a>, incidentally one of the very first pieces of software I used when switching to include computer generated sounds as well as hardware generated.

For me personally, they are all worthy of investigation, but are still only tools and so as with many things are not some secret answer to making 'that' sound, the real answer for that is learning how sound works, or obviously simply experiment.
