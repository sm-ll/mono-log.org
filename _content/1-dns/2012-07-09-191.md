Recent days have been spent adjusting to the new sounds and their activity in our studio. These sounds are not coming from a new source but more through a familiar source a similar set of sounds are occurring once again. Almost through a want to initiate familiarity, these sounds seem to occur again. However, as do all periods of adjustment, comes a time of perspective and motivation for a new relationship with these sounds, a new pattern to form what might become familiarity once again, but a familiarity different from what came before.

Through listening to these sounds, remembering the sounds of before, and finding ways to make new sounds comes uncertainty and excitement. The uncertain now, becoming the certain later. The new of now, becoming the old of the future.

Perhaps then what can be found in transitions and adjustment to sound, is a basis and abstraction to think of other affairs, other adjustments that we are perhaps less able or willing to hear or listen to.

I hope you can enjoy todays sound, however it might be heard.
