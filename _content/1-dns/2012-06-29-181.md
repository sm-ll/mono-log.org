Again, apologies for those who are on a similar time as me in London, it's 02:47AM here at the moment and I agree it is late.

There is a reason for the lateness, I have been busy working on a new project called Bitcite.com that I am very, very excited about. Bitecite.com aims to bring all sort of inspiring and creative people of all walks of life whether a most respected figure or someone nobody has heard of. I like to put them all under one roof to share their inspiring stories, stories of any kind. Each story will come from or inform a short quote that will stand as the main focus of the story, enabling people to quickly read the quote, and been excited to read the story behind it. 

I am trying to make the website the best I possibly can, but launch it as quickly as I can, and so this has been taking up quite a bit of my time.

While working on Bitecite.com, I have been enjoying some wonderful sounds today in my headphones from yet another style I have experimented with and performed with in the past, and have yet rarely followed. This is not due to the music not being good, but as I have said before on this blog, it is sometimes because it is 'so' good that I tend to avoid these things until the time seems right. Sometimes I feel it is nice to listen with limitations.

After a long time of dipping into and out of these styles, now the time seems right to open that can and to really let it in, and I have to say I am pleased I have. 

It has been through doing this blog an amazing, but hard, transformation seems to be taking place in my passion to create and share and understand much more about who I am, what I like, and where I should be going. Throgh doing something like this everyday, and thinking about it just a little each day, I have really started to notice when things are right, when things feel me, and through experiencing more confidence and determination I have been able to make many more things happen. I am really very happy I started this daily upload and I have the chance to share all this with you all.

So, todays sound is coming from my interest in dub/techno, and references the <a href="http://echocord.com/" title="echocord" target="_blank">echocord</a> label. What I like particularly about this music is the how it can be loud and yet not intrusive, its incredibly repetitive nature, how it shows great restraint, and ultimately how it demonstrates an incredible balancing of sound to noise. All these things are hugely important for me.

This is perhaps my purest creation of this type of sound that I have created so far with the Nord Modular, and I wanted to achieve it again within one patch so to not get to carried away, and so the result is perhaps more textural than beat driven. I could have easily played with this sound for a long, long time, but this is the result as it stands.

I also made it a little longer as I know some of you will appreciate this, I hope you enjoy this late upload. 

Thanks again for listening and all the support, you are all wonderful, wonderful people.
