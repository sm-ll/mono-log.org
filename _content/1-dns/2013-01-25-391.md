The look of a machine looking back, wanting to be used. It is as if it already knows what it wants, the patterns to make on it, the settings it asks to be inputted.

The machine doesn't need to be turned on to be attractive like its modern software variation, it can simply be, subdued, unlit, yet still able to entice.

The machine knows what it is, its confident, specific, focused. It has a name and a shape that can be held and touched.

The machine has a sound, a sound unlike another, subtly its own. The characteristics of the machine embed themselves into its very existence.

The machine wants to be touched, wants to be turned on and whats to be used.
