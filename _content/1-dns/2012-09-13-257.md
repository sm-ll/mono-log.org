Tonights upload is inspired by the imminent arrival of my Roland TR-606, the drum machine I have longed to own once again and honestly didn't think I would so soon.

I know once this machine arrives there tomorrow, there will be lots of sounds that machine could create that I am dying to create in the Nord Modular, or use as a starting point to explore.

Friday night will be an exciting on I am sure.

Until then, something of a familiar sound, but a new groove that I think you will like if you liked some of those previously.

I hope you enjoy.
