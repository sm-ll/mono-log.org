Today I have been re-working a <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_172/" title="previous upload">previous upload</a> for one of the tracks on the first 12" release on my label Sm-ll.

While working on this I remembered this was a particular Nord patch that I didn't entirely work out how something worked. There was a shifting of patterns that sort of happen slightly by accident. Shifting was what I was going for, but I didn't expect the result I got. Well, today I managed to unpick this patch and work out what was going on. I have a feeling though, the Nord shouldn't behave the way it is, but I am able to recreate it, which is fine by me.

Todays upload then, started off exploring this shifting, then almost went into some house like groove, until I stripped it back to what it is now.

I have to say I am quite happy with it.

Additionally, with the exception of the slightest bit of delay from the Inkel, everything else is one patch on the Nord, so no Space Echo or Phasor on this one. I think its fair to say, going back to the dry sound of the Nord has released some differences in how I work on the sounds.

I hope you enjoy it.
