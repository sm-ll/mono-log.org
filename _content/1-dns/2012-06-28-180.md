So a bit of a strange sounding upload today, I am not sure what to make of it to be honest, although at the moment it’s not really doing it for me…time will tell. I hope the writing will make up for it.

So today I decided to do something I have been wanting to do for a long time, and thanks to <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/" title="Seth Godin’s amazing motivating book entitled Poke The Box" target="_blank">Seth Godin’s amazing motivating book entitled Poke The Box</a>, I was always to get that idea done. And I have got to say, it feels great

The building in which our studio resides is perhaps one of the noisiest places I have lived and worked in. It is so noisy in fact that I even wrote my degree paper around the experiences I have had while being here. 

Its not that the neighbours are noisy, as to be fair the ones that I live near at least are pretty quiet. What has come to be a bigger problem is that through the structure of the building. It is an old factory building that has been converted into work/live studios and although what separates each floor and separate some of the units on each floor is solid concrete, as anyone knows this conducts sound very well. Sound simply travels.

Having said that, I sometimes wonder if the floors are made of paper as sound travels so well. I hear arguments well enough to pick a side, I hear fornication well enough to know to be intimidated or not. I hear doors banging, dogs barking, phones ringing. I hear television sets, food processors, singing, laughing, footsteps, things dropping and rolling into corners. I can even discern between the different shoes my neighbours might be wearing.

Next to my 4 floor building is the other small 3 floor section of our building. This runs parallel with ours at a distance wide enough to drive a car through. What this means is we have what is best described as a cavernous and reflected surface that amplifies all the sounds outside or from open windows from our building and the one opposite. 

In addition to this, we have large 5 story buildings opposite our building and in-between them and us is rather active Irish Travellers site. The small collection of travellers ‘we’ have near us, are very, very loud. Their sounds reflect from the surrounding buildings and street and echo around endlessly.

As you can imagine from this brief description, it is quite full of sound/noise where I live.

During my degree I wanted to attempt to remove many of these noise as I perceived them, and replace them with sound. I wanted to nurture a relationship akin to one we might have with a friend or a loved one, but with sounds. Within a relationship, there is always a language or social interaction, an exchange of systems, of inference. With sound this doesn’t occur. Sound simply leaves its origin, and cares not where it ends up. It is there to be heard or listened to regardless.

Although I have raised complaints, it is the system that requires complaints to investigate, regardless of if I wish to complain or just investigate. The process is a policy of punishment through making noise. I can’t say I totally agree with this, and feel it needs to be looked into.
However, my immediate concern is not so much to stop the noise, but change the noise into sound. From a sound that I dislike, to one that I have a different relationship with. This is very hard.

Today I decided to act upon two sounds in my building. The first sound is coming from opposite my unit door, and is a sound of another door, but this one likes to bang. The second sound is from the 1st floor, I live and work on the 3rd floor. This sound is a Boarder Collie dog that barks at almost anything that disturbs it. As we already know my building is noisy, this dog thinks so too, but choose to make even more noise. I presume this to be a language barrier issue.

I have toyed with the idea to knock on the doors to these people, as I have in the past with other units, and humanise the situation. In trying to understand and relate to the issue of sound I can hear, this allows my relationship with sound to change. I sympathise, or I can project myself to their home when I hear their sounds, and not be in a void of unknowing as I would have been previously.

This time I did something different than knocking the door. I decided on sticking a sign opposite their door written in big black marker the sound I hear. My closest neighbours read BANG!, those on the 1st floor had the sign reading WOOF! In addition to the sign reading WOOF!, I added some writing from my degree on the back, highlighting the areas I thought interesting to the situation. Each sign had my unit number and a smiley face at the bottom.

My hope in this is not to annoy or upset anyone, or even stop these sounds, but draw attention to the fact that these sounds are being heard. I wonder if these neighbours will come knock my door and what they will say. I wonder if they will think about their neighbour in their homes, as I think about them in mine whenever I hear their sounds. 

I imagine that I am not in their daily thoughts, but perhaps through this sign, I might be, and they might think about sound in a different way.

Equally I will now attribute the door bang, and the dog woof, with these signs, and this little project. I will now not think of the loudness of these sounds, or how they make me jump, distract me from my task in hand or even annoy as sounds can so easily do, but I will hopefully smile to myself as I await a change, or a visit from a curious neighbour.

My gut instinct tells me the reaction might be one similar to that of the relationship and how these rules work. If we shake someones hand, they shake back. If we kiss them on the check they kiss the other. If we end the conversation, they know when to leave. The reaction could be then, another sign, stuck opposite my door, reading of a sound ‘they’ hear…perhaps.

I sit excited by whats to come, and eager to hear the sound again, to see if it has changed, at least for now anyway.
