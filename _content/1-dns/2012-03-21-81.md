An unusual one for todays upload compared to those of late, this is how it goes somedaysâ€¦I quite like it though. This sound comes from more attempts at creating something close to PulsarGenerator, although I feel 'close' is all I am going to be able to achieve as technically it isn't possible in the Modular. Still, I will keep going at it and share the occasional attempt, and see what does come from it.

Initially this sound was more abstract than it is now, as a nice hollow sound and intense pulse thudding, although I thought to balance with a bass tone and some interesting high frequencies textures for the upload, the high frequencies also generated from a similar patch to the thuds. Again, there are some artefacts form the mp3 conversion mainly evident on the pulses in the background, creating a more whooshing quality to them, compared to the more sharp edge sound they originally had. Also I noticed the bass and high frequency combinations, creating more interesting sounds again from the conversion, again I kinda like it.
