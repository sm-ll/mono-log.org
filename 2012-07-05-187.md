## Early hour sketch.

So a bit of a later upload than even usual tonight and as a result a bit rough sounding, although certainly having its charm. And so I thought I would make up for this in sharing a screen grab of the patch used to make it.

I combined some of the things I often do in a patch so this might be learned from.

I hope the screen grab is useful and you enjoy this upload.
