## MFB Kraftzwerg.

Today my partner Lucia got her MFB Kraftzwerg semi-modular analogue synthesizer, and what a wonderful little box it is too.

I had a quick sneaky go after returning from work and found in the quick play I had the sort of sound that would fit well in many techno or pulse like tracks, those that have multiple textures and rhythms folding over and into each other. I am sure you know the sounds or feel I mean.

I feel the main reason for this characteristic is trough the LFO section being able to oscillate itself, and with the modular style patching to part of the synth, it can be routed to other sections of the synth. Really quite a cool sounding box, and one I was tempted to upload the recording of. 

However, I decided instead of moving away from the Nord Modular with the new toys we are getting, that I should stay focused and use these different patching of the Kraftzwerg, to explore in the Nord Modularâ€¦a much better idea I think.

Tonights upload then, is a similar take on what I recorded in the Kratzwerg earlier in the evening, emulating quickly the hiss texture that seems to sit with lower frequencies in the Kraftzwerg. I just compared them, and although certainly each synth has its own unique character, I would say if you like tonight upload, that it might be worth looking into the MFB Kraftzwerg as a synth to create those Techno-esque textures and synth swarms.

I hope you enjoy it. I recommend either headphones or loud.
