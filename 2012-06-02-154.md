I have not long returned from being away for part of this weekend, so just a quick post for todays upload.

Some further experiments in the cancelling and colliding of notes and texture filled patterns, progressing my understanding a little of the Nord Modular. Very much in the same way yesterdays post had a sort of shifting feel through a part cancelation of sound, todays also has this, albiet in a more fractured quality,having a slightly unusual quality to it, and reminding a little of some of the early clicks n cuts sound.

I am pretty exhausted from my travels, and so all things considered am quite pleased with what was reachable with tonights upload.

I hope you enjoy it.
