## Cutting away.

A very quick post as I have to wake up for work in 4 hours.

This upload works mainly with only TB-303, with the slight introduction of a subtle textured TR-606. Again this was a case of stripping back what I was working with until only the raw and essential parts of the sounds were enough to make everything sit as I wanted it.

I was quit enjoying creating this one, even having my eyes closed while I tweaked the sounds. This is certainly something I recommend doing if you don't already. Especially if you use computer a great deal in your work. Remember to turn away, or better still turn the monitor off while tweaking those sounds, it really does make a huge difference.

Speaking of closing my eyes, I think that is what I will do right now. Enjoy the upload.
