Some late night manual shifts tonight inspired by <a href="http://eliadwagner.com/2011/06/27/distant-galaxies-here-we-come/" title="this post">this post</a> which I found today while looking for a mixer to suit my way of working these days. I think I may have found it. :)

I have been looking for a basic mixer, something a bit quirky, cheap, kind of cool looking and possibly with a built in delay of sorts. I didi not know I would find such a cool thing as I did today.

To top it off the first demo the guy shares using this mixer is a MC-202 stab sound that is almost the sort of thing I would make with. Very pleased.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload, and if you have this mixer, I want it :)
