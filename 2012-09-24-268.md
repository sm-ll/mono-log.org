## Inkel variations.

Some variations on last nights upload, this one a much slower groove, with a far more gritty feel.

The more I make these minimal rhythmical grooves, the more I am keen to play them live. I have to say I am enjoying creating them a great deal.

I hope your enjoying them tooâ€¦and keep your eyes peeled for a Inkel Mixer for me. :)
