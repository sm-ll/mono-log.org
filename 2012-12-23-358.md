So it approaching that time a year already I can't believe where all the time has gone and how things have changed in that time either.

I guess we all use this time in beginning to reflect on what we might have achieved or failed at. I added up the hours of these uploads today, I was surprised at it roughly totalled around 30 hours worth. I don't know why but this seems only a small number compared to the hours and days that have gone in. It is this thought and a few others that found their way to me today that reminded me once again of it all comes down to just how you look at it…a matter of perspective.

I have learnt a great deal in doing these uploads, not just in the Nord Modular, but about myself, how I do things, how I think, how I feel. I have begun to let go of certain ideas that I might have thought embedded in me and have started to really appreciate direction and focus of myself and where I want myself to be in this world and to others.

It is amazing how the act of actually doing something, partnered with the thinking about that doing makes for a really incredible combination and one I really can't recommend enough to anyone reading this who is already finding excuses 'not' to do that thing you think you should.

Just do it!!!!

I mean I read these sorts of articles or books that talk as if there is some magic formula to doing stuff, and in part they are right, but the trouble with these is I just can't get that feeling from reading, and only from doing something. Seeing as the doing is often the problem to begin with, or the feeling right while doing is the problem, this results in little progress.

I tried something a little while back and for the first time I was able to pass over the comparison of the feeling in actually doing, and that of wanting or promising to do but never actually doing it.

If you would like to I would think about trying this yourself, its kind of fun and stupid at the same time.

I put a cup on the table and asked someone to think to desire to move the cup, to basically have all the want and focus on moving that cup, saying out loud "I am going to move it right now, right fu***ng now!!!, this second" etc etc but never actually move it. I found getting really energetic, all hot and worked up about it really works well. After all that effort behind wanting to move something but not actually moving it…then just reach over without thinking and move it.

I found this was exactly what it feels like, and I would recommend anyone who thinks about doing something, but never does, to try this. I would love to hear what you feel and if it is just me…I know it is kind of dumb, but I think it might help, so whats the harm.

Enjoy the upload.
