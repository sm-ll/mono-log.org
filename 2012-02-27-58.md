## Further Edits.

As I have mentioned before, I am often finding the complexity of the patch in the Nord Modular, or in some cases multiple patches, to be slightly off putting to my perception of the sounds. When listening to the sounds later having removed the patch, the sounds change, becoming generally much clearer and often simpler than I had remembered.  

Today I wanted to create something that I had previously achieved in multiple patches, but this time rework the sound in a way that it would fit into just one patch. I wondered if this would allow me to feel much like one might when having tidied up their home or when wearing a freshly iron shirt.
