## Oberkorn dub.

Today has been a day of relaxing, catching my breath from the busy weeks, and spending time with Lucia looking at some gorgeous machines over at the Analogue Solutions website. In particular <a href="http://www.analoguesolutions.org.uk/concussor/oberkorn.htm" title="one machine caught my eye,">one machine caught my eye,</a> well actually many did, but the Oberkorn Sequencer creating an itch in my wallet like no other.

The main reason I liked this machine, is its simplicity of function and yet knowing that through this an amazing amount of flexibility could be achieved. 

I can imagine working with dials to control voltage in other synths, and imagined the feeling I have long missed, of having dedicated boxes for certain tasks. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I feel it is certainly something to do with that building of a relationship with equipment that helps creativity along that much better.

I can feel 2013 will certainly see some new additions to the studio, but only with the upmost consideration in being able to create sounds that either sound like the Nord Modular or has the same subtleties. I have had the experience of having a sound change some much with the new introduction of equipment, and very much want to steer clear of this path this time round. Ideally to build a set up that mimics what I can already do with the Nord Modular, but through separate pieces of equipment. Why would I do that you might ask? Well, I know for sure that to create anything identical is impossible, and it is in those subtle difference that I enjoy exploring.

Todays upload is most certainly been inspired by the clean and elegant design of some of the machines at Analogue Solutions, and so shares some simplicity, being dry, mono, and raw, and even uses a similar concept behind the sequencing of the sounds as would the Oberkorn.

I hope you enjoy it.
