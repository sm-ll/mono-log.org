# 114
## Nord dub 2.
audio: 114

For todays upload I thought I would do some preparation work yesterday evening, and decided to research into creating a delay within the Nord Modular. I have had an idea of how it could be done, but figured instead of working it out, I would see if someone else has already done this for me…<a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/nordmodularbook/nm_delay_effects.html" title="which they had." target="_blank">which they had.</a>

Unfortunately, or fortunately<a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/nordmodularbook/nm_delay_effects.html" title=" Sommerville's patch" target="_blank"> Sommerville's patch</a> wouldn't load in my Nord for some reason, but this turned out to be a good thing. The patch is pretty easy to copy, with most of the settings being visible from screen shots. However, after hearing this patch, I was a little surprised at the clunkiness of it, but from programming my own could quickly see what could be done to improve it.

I have patched in a wet/dry control, tuned the delays to sound better suited for my own uses, and also put in controls for envelope settings on both the delay and the dry signal. I also in trying to create a feedback, accidentally implemented in an option to allow it to be used as a really affective midi looper, allowing some experimenting with sound similar to what can be created with any audio looper such as a <a href="http://www.ehx.com/products/stereo-memory-man-with-hazarai" title="Memory Man">Memory Man</a>.

Todays upload definitely has some nice sounds within it, particularly the muted chord in the right channel, but feel it is more a demonstration of sounds with the delay more than anything else. I am often finding a need to go through  a few stages of getting to grips with the patch before I can really get out of it what I feel totally happy with, but for the most part I am pretty pleased thus far, and gotta say I am pretty excited in general by the potential of this new direction with the Nord Modular, and am really keen to create some midi based loops and more delay fun.

Hope you enjoy todays upload…oh, also if you fancy your Nord Modular G1 to delay too, email me and I am more than happy to share the patch with you.
