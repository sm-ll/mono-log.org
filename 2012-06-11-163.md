So todays upload is yep, you guess it, <a href="http://www.makesnd.com/" title="SND" target="_blank">SND</a> inspiredâ€¦well :)

Although, not the new SND that you might have been expecting, but a particular part of their sound in general that for me stands as there most enjoyable aspect.

I think for me this aspect of SND is one in the lack of obvious FX used, and more a choice in the attention in balancing the sounds to be either dry or full. There is rarely an FX used to fill out sound or used to make a perhaps otherwise unpalatable sound more typically what we might expect. It magnifies space more than any artificial reverb can. For me this has always been a huge reason for enjoying SND's output, that and the general lack of it.

Todays sound pays homage to the lesser obvious sound of SND found on their alum <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Snd-Stdio/master/84443" title="Stdio and the track 00018 Old End Ng" target="_blank">Stdio and the track 00018 Old End Ng</a> (track 10 to me).

This isn't the first time I have attempted to dissect this track, I have had a go before while doing these uploads, although just couldn't get it where I wanted. Today I tried a slightly more long winded and perhaps more obvious method and got it somewhere that felt interesting to me. Again, this is more in reference to this work of SND, and useful for various reasons for me.

It reminds me again of how I used to create music back in the 90's, playing other peoples music while I began sequencing in the grid, until eventually switching over to my own sound. I think it is a useful method to not only learn about someone else work, but to put the mind in a mode in order to create. Ironically I was pleased to read in a recent <a href="http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/magazine/mark-fell-interview" title="Mark Fell interview" target="_blank">Mark Fell interview</a>, his best to date, how he and Mat used to basically try and copy people, and doing it badly is partly how their style began, a brilliant story.

I hope you enjoy todays upload, again it is done through the speakers in our very reverberate studio, so I hope it sounds good in your listening environment.
