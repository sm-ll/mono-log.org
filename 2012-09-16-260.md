## Simple tone texture.

Today me and Lucia have been working together on a forthcoming show where we have been experimenting with Tape Loops. This isn't something either of us have done before strangely enough. The reason we decided on trying it this time was the nature of the performance and the source material coming from Daphne Oram. We felt a certain sound was needed and tape loops seemed to be the obvious choice, although having said that it didn't really pop into our minds so easily, but obviously looking back it was obviousâ€¦you know what I mean.

So for tonights upload, I felt a textured sound was on the cards, especially as it has been sometime since making one. I realise only yesterday I mentioned my mood being more rhythmic, well what a difference a day makes.

With that in mind, it does go to show how much of an influence somethings can be. Working with Lucia on Mimosa Moize projects is always a very experimental working process, and it has been a real joy to work together again after what has been a lengthy break. We feel the Daphne Oram sounds we are working with fits nicely in with where we are independently with our own sounds, and serves as a nice break from the normal Mimosa Moize sound, and yet still sharing much in common. It should be a good show we hope.

Hope you enjoy the textured tones I jammed for tonights upload. It has a sort of edgy, yet pleasant sound to it I am quite enjoying.

Thanks for listening.
