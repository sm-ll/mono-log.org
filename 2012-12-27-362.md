## Iconic machines influence on creativity.

So this morning I caught myself saying how much I preferred the Roland TR606 to the TR808 drum machine, and although I still feel this way, I did start to wonder why this is the case.

So for todays upload I thought I would continue emulating the 808 drum machine in the Nord Modular, specifically working on the Bass Drum, Hats, Congas and Clave, and that through doing so perhaps I would be a little closer to understanding why the 606 is my preference.

I think after listening to the 808 closely and comparing it to the 606, appart from its sounds being cleaner and perhaps it sounding a little less interesting as a result, it does sound a lot closer to the 606 than I remember when I owned an 808…yes I sold it…yes I regret that…no I don't know what I must have been thinking.

I think what is perhaps the stand out difference was how it is used and more importantly what it has been used on and how that affects me using it.

I remember back when I had my 808, I also owned my 606 and often found myself going to the 606 again and again, finding its limitations insisting that I found ways to use its sounds more creatively. 

Alternatively, when turning on the 808, I just kept hearing so many electro records or techno records that as a young influential kid could not escape.

It seems after some 14 years later the 808 doesn't remind me so much of these early tracks anymore, but more of the 606 if anything. What perhaps has been the influence of this change more than anything else, is the pulling appart of these sounds through trying to recreate them in the Nord Modular. No longer do I hear the classic tracks of the 80's and 90's, but the sine waves, the envelopes, how multiple sounds seem to be using similar techniques keeping the technology and expense affordable. I never noticed so much white noise used in the toms before, or the simplicity f the bass drum and claves. 

Its as if through pulling appart the sounds of both the 606 and 808, I have found a new way into those sounds, a dnew way to be creative with them, and ultimately a new and refreshing way of listening to them, again, thanks to the Nord Modular.

I can't say this upload really sounds like I am using 808 like sounds, and can only think that is because of once again being inside the sounds  and this is always difficult in hear after just creating something, but also that I might be just simply hearing them as tones or white noise and constructing something with that as apposed to the iconic and almost burden on creativity that is the TR-808.

Obviously this is all just a thought, but it does beg the question how much a piece of iconic machinery not only delivers a sound we are familiar with, but insists it is used iconically during any creation with it. Food for thought.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this upload…and yes I think I might want an TR-808 again, although I doubt it will still be the £250 it was when I saw it in a second hand shop window.
