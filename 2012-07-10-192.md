## Deep chords.

Tonight I have revisited a subset of ideas that fall under my alias Pokk!, these were exploring the dub feel, along with shifting patterns but with only chord and texture to create the movement that would normally be with rhythm.

I took much inspiration from some work by <a href="http://www.biosphere.no/" title="Biosphere" target="_blank">Biosphere</a>, mainly his release Substrata + Man With a Movie Camera, and also perhaps Cirque. Biosphere would often use smooth bass and looping sampled chords and sounds often bordering on a dub feel, but never quite completely going there, or at least from what I heard. There seemed to much in common to my ears, and with the process of creating the sounds and how there were used, that a connection was dying to be experimented with.

For this upload I thought I would explore this idea, and although some previous uploads have come quite close to this sound this was never intentional, although a nice reminder of this slightly more experimental side of Pokk!.

It takes a little while to sink in I find, but once inside it sits rather nicely. I hope you enjoy it.
