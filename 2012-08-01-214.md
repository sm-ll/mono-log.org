A late upload tonight, sorry for those who have been waiting. Me and Lucia have had a lovely evening spent with our friend <a href="http://www.tommudd.co.uk/" title="Tom Mudd" target="_blank">Tom Mudd</a>, an evening talking about music, sharing stories, eating lovely food and sipping on the occasional <a href="http://www.glenmorangie.com/" title="Single Malt" target="_blank">Single Malt</a>.

I thought due to the lateness I would use this chance to create something ultra minimal, knowing full well this actually means things will generally take just as long if not longer to create. However, I feel I have found an interesting balance of simplicity and groove, that certainly in this very early hour of 3:30AM, along with my slight fuzzy head, sounds ok. 

I'm pleased.

I hope its sound good to you too, and I will endeavor to upload a little earlier if I can.
