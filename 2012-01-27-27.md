## Simple steel.

A slight delay in uploading this one, apologies for this. Yesterday was a day filled with roadworks, dogs barking and a headache that persisted throughout which didn't help my creativity at all.

As a result of these disruptions, this is only a simple FM sound, and small step towards using the chord that eventually took on an unexpected steel drum quality. It's not great, but I quite like it for what it is.
