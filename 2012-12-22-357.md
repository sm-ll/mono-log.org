## Consumed in delay.
audio: 357

I have been listening to Plastikman's Consumed today pretty much on repeat, and so thought to create something that is inspired by this muted and fx heavy sound found in this album for tonights upload.

This upload leads to me to think already of tomorrows, where I might explore the texture of the Dynacord delay a little more specifically, and try to re-create this in the Nord Modular.

I often find a step away is needed to take a step forward, quite looking forward to tomorrow already :)

But before then, I hope you enjoy tonights.
