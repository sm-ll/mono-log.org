More FM rhythmical experimenting, although this time using the built in sequencers and 3 operators. Simple AD envelopes and a little bit of FM feedback here and there.
I have modelled this upload slightly in homage to the SND album 'Stdio' on Mille Plateaux, although mine sounds very different indeed and not nearly as good. This SND album was the first I heard of theirs, buying it shortly after first experiencing their incredible minimal track on the hugely classic compilation album 'Clicks N Cuts' also on Mille Plateaux, an album that still stands up very well today. If you haven't heard either of these albums, then I highly recommend you track yourself down a copyâ€¦enjoy. 

(I will be away Sunday and so I will upload Snd 22 when I return either late Sunday evening or Monday morning, sorry about this.)
