## Stacks of inspiration.

This afternoon and evening I have been going through some CD's picking out tracks that I hope will be something special for the Sm-ll soundcloud page in the weeks to come.

The idea is a Influence of the past mix, and perhaps later still a inspiration of the present mix.

When I say mix, what I really mean is me going through and picking out the best bits, sounds, sections, loops etc to create what I hope will be both the story that has brought me to Sm-ll, but also an inspiration for Sm-ll too.

I am realising that this is quite a big job, but I have been wanting to do this for a long time in some form or another and now seems the right time.

As a result of listening through the many CD's I pulled form the shelf, the inspiration for tonights upload has been great and varied.

To be honst I was for a second not sure what to do, and feared as I often do, that I would struggle to get some focus for tonights upload. Well, that still happened, and the upload has been a tough one to nail down. Very nearly it was a fast paced techno style upload, but I just couldn't bring myself to share that. It then turned into something similar to how it is now but a much fiercer sound.

Eventually I turned almost all the sounds down, and balanced them all once again, to reach at what is a nice, calm, groove that I am pretty pleased with at present. I really like to try and find that sound which is both loud, yet easily talked over. I use this often as a gauge at hitting the right spot, although rarely do I get it right.

I hope you enjoy this upload.
