So today I got to do something I have been itching to do for a long long time…use a Roland Space Echo once again.

A little recap.

Back when I was 15/16 years old, I was lucky enough to know a friend who was selling his Roland Space Echo, the RE-150. Around that time I had little money, and even less equipment, and I alway felt looking back this was probably my strongest asset.

The equipment I plugged into my Space Echo were a Roland TR-606 Drum Machine, creating the metalic drum sounds, and clicking pulse like thuds…an Roland SH-101 monophonic synth, to create bass like pulses and bass sounds, wobbles etc, and lastly a Juno 60 polyphonic synthesizer, used to more textural, drones, tone and chords etc. I also got a free Transcendent 2000 synthesizer which was in bad condition, but was free with the Juno 60. The classic story of someone having one in their attic and passing it onto someone who might use it. I modified this to work with the filter input, to create more interesting unstable filtering. 

With these all plugged into the Space Echo, everything had delay on it and so the sounds would have to be used in such a way to work. The tracks at the time were created with relatively little experience of other music, as I generally enjoyed making it more than listening to it in the early days. I think anyone who makes their own will understand what I mean, I mean many hobbies or passions, you can enjoy music while you do that interest, but if making music this is obviously not possible.

As a result of this, much of my early music sounded very dubby, although this is really something I only realised later listening back with more educated ears. I even remember a time not even liking proper dub music itself, although knowing it was good, could not relate. Well eventually this would change, as I came to learn of the many similarities I personally hear. The repetition, the groove, the system that creates what it is, a finding and using of technology for a purpose beyond its initial thinking…something I would like to hear more of in todays music.

Anyway, history over. Moving forward, it dawned on me that perhaps my most enjoyable of all them music I created was these very early tracks, some that  still have, which were creating using this limited equipment. Unfortunately after I came to really understand this, the equipment was long gone, sold mainly through it not being used, or faults.

Today I was able to finally put the first piece of the puzzle back together, and bought myself a Roland Space Echo, although this time the RE-201, the model above mine as a teenager, this one with some incredible reverb.

So why am I saying all this?

Well today I wondered should I or shouldn't I create my upload with or without this new, yet old friend? I mean the idea is to only use the Nord Modular. I am not going to justify why I should be able to use it, as something much simpler happen. I used it…and it sounded so amazing, I just had to share it with you.

Yeah yeah I broke the rules, but you know what…who cares, I might even carry on uploading after a year, so that would be breaking the rules then. :p

I not going to make a habit of it, and will be keeping the Space Echo stuff for finished work :p, but for today, as it means so much to me, ad I hope you too in some way, I thought I would add some Space Echo to my upload.

I hope you enjoy.
