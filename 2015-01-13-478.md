Sleepy morning, created some sort of moody ambient dubby sound, trying out the sequencing of the Korg Volca Sample from the 101 being triggered by the 606.

Lots of reverb and colliding timings. It has a kind of early Plastikman crossed with early Aphex Twin vibe in places, well, it reminded me of this while making it, and I went with that.

Enjoy.
