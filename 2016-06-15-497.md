## early hours with supercollider
---

Some very late night coding with Supercollider after many failed attempts to get into the studio and then my mixer power supply died. Still, it's a reason to try something in the laptop.

All the sounds are created and sequenced in Supercollider, quite the software once you get the hang of it.

Enjoy.
