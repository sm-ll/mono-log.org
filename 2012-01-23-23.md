## I brought something back…

After quite a busy but fun weekend away I have returned home to an environment I must admit I am all the more appreciative of. I often find when returning to my home town to see friends and family, although an enjoyable experience for the most part, it is always a relief to be back in London and more specifically back to a habitual routine and all that is familiar but refreshing.

For me personally, I find trips away are often stressful and I often feel fidget, a constant want to work or talk about work is building inside me all the while I am away. The idea of talking a break in itself doesn't at all work for me, I never want to have a break and only take a break when I can no longer be productive, simply dropping from exhaustion. The ideal of relaxing on the beech for example does nothing for me but create a sense of anxiety as time moves past as I sit still within it. A silly but clearly present small sensation of anger builds towards 'the rest' who seem so effortless in how they relax.

When I consider this recent trip away, with all its preparation and time used up in its travelling, I can't help feel that my time away feels like a collecting of a metaphorical weight, a absorbing of a glue stilting any progress. This is not to say that progress is simply about doing more, as this obviously could never be so simply understood as this, but more there is an obligation to our personal past, that try as we may, will always be there to remind us of what we were, and pose the difficult question of what and where are we now? While away there is a need to demonstrate your position now in your life to those you have left behind, a desire to fall back into those familiare old ways and good old times. There can be a slight clashing of opinion, of direction and of belief, all battling holding notions of experience of 'progress', reflection and change.

When returning home I feel exhausted, wanting to flush away the history brought back to the current developing idea of what can be called home. If asked in a cursory moment the question ‘did you enjoy your time away?’, the answer often comes as courteous as the question, ‘yes it was lovely’ is the reply, and yet if I am truly honest when answering such a question, that although it is great to see that familiar town once again, and spend that much needed time with friends and family, I would have to say this experience always comes with a slight but clearly present bad taste, that causes the gaps in my visits to become longer and longer as each passes.

Now back in London and faced with a a large 'to-doo list', I find this visit to my home town still present as I sit here, influencing my creation made in the Nord Modular. A simple exploration in FM Synthesis this time comes with a strong desire to strip back, simplify, clean out, purify the mind and my actions that go with it. Exhausted and unsettled, the upload today comes in the form of a sort of shifting rhythmical glasslike sound that somehow seems to desire a want of familiarity and of normality, and yet perhaps is endowed with something else, something as of yet unidentifiable.
