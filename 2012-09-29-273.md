## Carter dub.

Some moody dub grooves for tonights upload. This one reminds me a great deal of John Carpenters music for the The Thing, a favourite film of mine.

I feel as well as sharing similarities to The Thing, it also shares a likeness with some of my previous uploads, and perhaps expanding slightly on how these could sound in more finished forms.

With this one being far calmer than many, the repetition seems less prominent, with textures and moods taking centre. I quite like this the more I hear it.

I hope you enjoy.
