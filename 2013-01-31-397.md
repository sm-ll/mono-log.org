## The benefits of restriction.

As I think back to last years benefits of repetition, the daily upload, the constant revisiting of previously thought problems, I am now faced with a new challenge.

For me the daily upload and its initial outline was, and always has been about the first year and the experiences and findings in that year. That year has passed, and in comes another. Now the daily upload, the daily post, is taking on a new shape, asking new questions, presenting new problems. It does therefore, now have to now find a new way of doing things. One found in restriction.

While experiencing various unexpected events this year already, some more challenging than others, I have on occasion missed an upload, broken or changed habit, and I have had to create two in one day, a difference in the day, changing the outcome. This pressure has actually ended up insisting things are kept simple, even more simple than before. Emphasis has been placed on perspective more than ever, on the sound itself and also the tool in which that sound has been created. The pondering of what if, how, or why, has been replaced with now, here, happening.

The daily upload is not about what its once was. For me that year has passed. What started in discovering, reference and finding placement, has now changed into something less certain. Now it seems time is spent finding the edges and pushing against them. Now seems a time where new things can occur, new ways of thinking, new ideas can be explored, and ultimately a new future as of yet standing uncertain.

As I have often said many times on this blog, I don't feel my creativity is one found in or using passion or emotion, but one of ideas, analysis and structure. More recently I wonder if passion and emotion is actually finding seeping in through the edges. Familiar times seem present, and yet new versions of this familiarity insist an uncertain progress.

Urgency is no longer a factor, through the relentless repetition has emerged normality, habit and comfort. The temptation of breaking everything that has been built is intoxicating. Change is good, this has always been good in my world. Ever since I can remember I have always believed in challenge and change. Often the need to hold back ensuring an awareness of change for change sake is not in play.

Perhaps through restriction, of what you can't do but might want to, comes another result, another perspective, that finds itself in enjoyment, emotion, passion and now. Time can be still for a while, and with still time, a restriction and resistance of wanting to urge things forward, comes a time of appreciating the now, and being comfortable with it, and to share it with others.

Things don't have to be pushed for them to find new results, sometimes things just happen. Much like words put down in a blog post, finding there way through a exploration of ideas and emotion combined to perhaps great a new, uncertain, and untouched or untouchable future.

Restriction is playing the role of a monitor, observing and reminding of what can or can't be done, and insisting time be handled like fire.
