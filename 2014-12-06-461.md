Raspy, bass heavy, slow and dub movements. A Simple Nord Modular patch based on the 101, but with a direct connection of those raw oscillators balanced against the bass. Also one of my favourite kick sounds, the 606 BD.

Some effects are used, but there is a small section at the end that is raw Nord Modular G1.

Enjoy.
