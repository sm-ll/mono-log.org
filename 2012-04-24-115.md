## Sm-ll sketches.

So I am quite excited today, I tend to talk a lot when I am excited, others will say I just simply talk a lot, but anyway, my excitement is for a multiple of reasons.

The first is I am very please with todays upload, which might seem a strange thing to say, but generally I am not someone who feels happy about what I create. This is not due to any level of standards or such things, but generally speaking I often feel I am creating something slightly separated from what I really want to create, that somehow things are governed by something outside of myself. Todays upload is the beginning of something I have been wanted to experiment with for far to many years, a sketch of whats to come perhaps.

The second reason I am excited is I am realising some of my dreams and goals in life are coming true, which I think anyone would be pleased with, its nice. These are not big dreams of money or such things, but more aspects of myself, the people round me and general experiences and thoughts of aiming to better. I often have a perspective of myself, as we all do, and this perspective is often one jarring along with our actions and intentions. Obviously this is always the case, but I suppose what can be best described as a feeling of making a little break through, it is this that has occurred for me today, which is obviously a great feeling.

And perhaps part of the breakthrough is found in the third reason today is going quite well. After many years of discussion with various people, and much considered thought myself, I have decided to start my own label. 

When I say label, I mean a certain type of label, and that for me is what I understand as a label. I don't want, or intend to get into a area of what a label should be or shouldn't be, for it isn't my place or anyones for that matter, to stipulate such things. However, I do know what 'I' feel a label should be for 'me', and this is something that I believe is no easy task, and this is the sort of label I will be starting.

That is all I am going to say about it for now, but I want to thank those who have been supportive on this matter over the years, and also those who have reminded me of certain things through meeting and sharing around this blog. I can't thank you enough. 

I intend to give back in the form of something that I hope is considered as special to others, as it will to me. 

In the meantime I hope you enjoy todays upload. :)
