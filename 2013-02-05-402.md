## Delivering your voice.

Something I have often struggled with is the ability of delivering my own voice. When creating work, there is often a part of me that holds back, trying to second guess myself or push down the obvious thing that I really want to do. The sound that I always long to hear is one I rarely attempt to create myself, and yet on the occasion that I have done so, the result is perhaps some of my personal favourites. Regardless of this accessional outcome, I am still faced with a force preventing me to do it again. I want to keep it safe, on an island in my head. It's brain crack.

What I have learned over recent years, is not only the silliness of this, but also a way to actually face this rather odd behaviour and finally create something that is closer to what I had always struggled to.

I believe there had always been something in my mind that prevented me in creating what I really wanted to, a fear that stopped me, worrying if it was wrong, or it does nothing for others or myself. Taking it out of my head and into sound, what if it actually sounds rubbish?

This wasn't a conscious fear, but one that was so deep down I probably didn't fully appreciate it was there at all. Now that I am able to create, create what I want through the act of repetition, doing each day, having to do, create and think less, I am finally able to tame the lizard brain, and finally be free in what I create.
