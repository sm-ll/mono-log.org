A quick post tonight as yet again its been another productive but busy day. Also tonight has come another quick creation, very pleased, and for the first time in a while I feel like I am just making tracksâ€¦its a great feeling.
More referencing of Stephan Mathieu's Full Swing Edits work, and very much a staple sound for me personally in many of my creations around the time hearing his work and before. The general granular textures and layers of colliding tones, all balanced more into sound than melody. I like his work of this era very much.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload, a nod towards but definite departure from <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Stephan-Mathieu-Full-Swing-Edits-3/release/180719" title="Ekkehard Ehlers. [Spater] Edit">Ekkehard Ehlers. [Spater] Edit</a>, or track 7.
