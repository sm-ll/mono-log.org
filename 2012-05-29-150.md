## Pattern shift.

A delicate experiment in pattern shifting is the result of todays tampering with the Nord Modular, and again one that sounds very different when stepped away from the controls.

I have always been interested in patterns, as all us humans always are, but for me, I probably take my enjoyment that little bit further than perhaps the average person might.

People often say these sorts of things are hereditary, and for the most part I agree, however, I remember my father taking a great deal of enjoyment out of things being perfectly inline, pictures on the wall were one his favourites, or those little clown ornaments on the mantel…the strange one made of glass or the little boy with a joke syringe?? I always found this sort of thing amusing and at the time being the typical disagreeing child, would believe 'I' preferred things off kilter.

Many years on, I can now appreciate how much I like things in line. Its no surprise I like typography, although not so much the varieties, but the precision embedded within such a field of expertise. I like grids, not just because they look cool, although they really do, but because again of what that grid symbolises and achieves. However, I do appreciate that things or shouldn't always have to be perfectly inline such as my fathers arrangement of living room accesseries. It is less a dislike of things that are perfect or 'correct', as I really do like correct,  but more the friction that correct and slightly incorrect can achieve when placed together.

Having thought again about my father, he did have perfectly inline pictures and clowns, but missed parts of the ceiling and carpet…I digress.

This sort of thinking is fine, until the realisation of what is perceived as correct is influenced largely by experience, and so if exposed to the exploration of the space just off the grid line, or the space created by the subtle shift, this too eventually becomes more the norm…at least for me. It then is realised that the norm for me, is one of years of personal experimentation and experience, and yet when presenting this personal norm to others, its seems wrong or clumsy.

I have battled over the years in making sounds and exploring other interests, in finding a balance both creatively and of my own perspective, and have started to realise through the help of others, that just because I might feel comfortable two feet from the grid line, it doesn't mean I have to go there. A honing in, a stepping closer to the grid line is in order, but now I am approaching this grid line with a newly formed perspective, one that is based on a two feet off perfect.

I used to have a reoccurring dream, where I was looking through a window or framing of life, onto a family looking out at me. They would normally be sat at their table, easting their food and wondering why I was looking in but not joining in. Perhaps this is another reason why this blog exists. I digress again.

It is really a matter of perspective that enables me to move forward I feel, and allows me to not just make things happen, but more importantly than that, to enjoy those things that I make, and enjoy that I make them. I can breath…or at least I am trying to take more breaths.

Todays sounds is a combination of shifts, ideas, experiments, and perhaps due to my motivation behind its creation, is why it almost sounds like a multiple of tracks layered. I think its interesting, albiet a little off kilter.

Lastly I just want to say thank you for everyones support once again. I had some lovely emails today, which has really made today a joy, and so I hope my sounds and thoughts can make yours enjoyable too.
