## Frequencies and rhythm.
audio: 329

Tonights upload is revisiting a more electronic rhythmical style perhaps heard before <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_228/" title="in a previous upload">in a previous upload</a>, with a more filled out structure in sounds, using the fuzz of high frequencies and the rolling repetition of bass tones, and clicks. 

I can't help shake the similarity to Frank Bretschneider's sound and although not intentionally emulating, I do very much like the idea of that as mentioned in many previous posts. For me, identifying another artists sound, it is more a metal categorising, association of sound, place, time etc. I imagine we all have this, and all hear someone else?

With this uploads sound being that much busier, I didn't feel the need to use the Space Echo not nearly as much as in some of the more recent uploads. The structure of the pattern is already doing enough in my mind. As a result of less effects, it is a much less dubbier sound, but still sharing much in the general feel of some of the recent uploads, which I l am enjoying.

For years and years I wanted to aim to basically write the same track over and over again, and although I am not doing that now, or really ever want to really achieve that, it is much closer than ever before with the repetition of daily uploads.

Again, I think should I really stop come 1st Jan 2013. I will certainly miss it that is for sure.

This is probably the longest of all the uploads coming in at nearly 9:30, I was quite getting into jamming with it, something I have been doing more and more with the effects being sat with so many tempting dials. Although I must try to remember to not always do this.

I was thinking to edit the upload before sharing it, but decided why not put it all up.

I hope you enjoy the repetition.
