## Clonk swing.

A simple sketch for tonights upload and my first experimenting with the classic swing feel in sequences. 

Although the effect can't really be heard here as much as it might, especially after my efforts to disguise it, it did however put the overall feel of the rhythm somewhere slightly different than perhaps possibly without it. 

Having said that perhaps it is more noticeable than I realise? as after working with swing for some time, the 'swing' feel tend to disappear as the ears adjusts, until it is switched off once again resulting in what is initially heard is a much more strict pattern than first thought. 

I wonder if this is the feeling many classic instrument performing musicians felt when they first heard sequencers in place of the performer?

Enjoy the sketch.
