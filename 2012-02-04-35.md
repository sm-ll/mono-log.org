## The morning rituals meet.

Another sound in preparation of our work in Canada and suddenly I feel things are starting to come together a little bit now.
It often is the case that in numbers, through repetition, what might have been an abstract idea or perceived as a unimportant single event, can begin to take some form, some structure, some importance. 

This makes me think of the morning ritual, as I have been reminded of it this morning while looking out our studio window to see the little old asian lady siting on the pavement to have a cigarette, something she does every morning. 

It is nice to feel that my morning ritual is influenced by hers, that we are connected in some way. I don't think she is aware of me seeing her, although I might be wrong, but it would be nice if I can return the compliment one day.

An image from a great work, and favourite of mine, from <a href="http://www.vvork.com/?p=6348" title="Félix González-Torres called Perfect Lovers">Félix González-Torres called Perfect Lovers</a>. I think somehow this is fitting today.
