There have been many great labels over the years for me, but alas many of them have adjusted or are exploring new forms of music. Although these new adventures in sound are often extremely good adventures for the most part, some of these labels do not get me quite as excited as they once hadâ€¦although I have been asking myself recently, is this really what is happening?

I am starting to wonder if it is not more my taste becoming even more particular, even more fussy? I find as I listen back to certain releases that I once enjoyed, many of these also don't excite me either, and unexpectedly sound quite normal by comparison to how I remembered them.

I have started to revisited many albums that I consider <i>the</i> album. I have found that it seems less the album that I enjoyed, although yes, still an amazing album in many cases, but perhaps it was more certain tracks <i>on</i> that album that I really enjoyed? Upon listening even closer I have found that maybe it wasn't even particular tracks that I enjoyed so much, although yes again, they are the best and most liked on the album, but it seems more a sound or arrangement of a sound within them that I thought was truly incredible and that really resonated for me.

I am starting to wonder, when considering taste, has it become less about tracks, albums and artists, and more about a case of matching sound to taste, a slow and developing refinement and exploratory discovery of those key ingredients we already have within us, and have just yet to fully realise and understand them.
