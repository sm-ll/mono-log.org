Soâ€¦I am feeling dubby tonight, I wonder why that is? :)

A pretty edgy and interesting mood in this one, it sort of wants to sit still and yet swell on occasion. Sporadic and unstable, yet solid and regular.

I have been listening to what I can find on Audio.nl today, a label that I adore and yet own nothing by. I have often found in the past artists and labels that I really resonante with, I have also been reluctant to buy the music. I can't say for sure why, but perhaps something about keeping this sound unpolluted in my mind, or sort of like a favourite food or special place that is enjoyed once in a while as a reminder, but not to fully indulge keeping it at arms length at all times. 

I think there is something to be said about not having what you want, and what with todays technology being what it is, I think it is more important than ever to say no sometimes to the things you can so easily have.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload.
