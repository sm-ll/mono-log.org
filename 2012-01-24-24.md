Further exploration of FM Synthesis and rhythmical patterns, here triggering the sound with various LFO’s. This particular mornings inspiration coming from a clear image in my mind of the colour yellow. I think of this colour as a sharp, clinical, striking yet not overly so, challenging colour.

I have very quickly created an image to suggest at my inspiration loosely inspired by dutch graphic designer Wim Crowell and the covers of Mark Fell and SND, in particular their album ‘Stdio’.
