## Reflection and repetition.

After only nine days of creating a sound each day in my Nord Modular, I have already learnt a great deal. I just can’t begin to imagine the collection of sounds I will have after a whole year and this thought brings me all the motivation I need to keep at it. It's quite likely that these sounds will bring about something worthy of release or at the very least a new direction or a refining of an existing one.

I don’t think there has been a collection of Nord sounds from one artist created like this before, at least not one I have found, and although this is not something I had considered until now, it does demonstrate the potency of a 'collection' of things, as apposed to those experienced as individually. With each morning passing and upload being made, slowly a collection of sounds are emerging that are in conversation with themselves and the sounds around them. I am very excited by what form they will take once a year is complete, and further, what smaller collections of sub styles might emerge out of this overall collection.

I am really enjoying the creative process being channeled and focused to that of only making a sound, and nothing more. I can concentrate on particular types of sounds in more detail, creating through an idea, concept or from inspiration, all the while not having to worry about larger matters such as context or more macro structure.

I really can’t recommend this enough, it really is a wonderful experience.
