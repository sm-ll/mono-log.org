## Something a little different.
audio: 53

Todays upload was going to be a replication of an old and slightly forgotten favourite electronic track of mine. Although quite excited to be revisiting this track, during its emulation things were sounding more like Plastikman than what I was aiming for. After adding some noise to start building a texture, I was suddenly struck at the similarity of it sounding like rain on a roof. Quickly I decided to leave my original plan and create something a little different.

I must admit I was a little hesitant to pursue this as itâ€™s a bit of a cliche, and almost thought I should create something entirely different, but finally decided on persevering.

Hopefully todays upload makes for an interesting listen.
