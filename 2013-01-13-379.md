A very quick post for Sunday's upload. Its actually Monday 2:30AM in the morning here.

Me and Lucia flew to Conpenhagen Saturday morning, 4:30AM start, to meet Finn Albertsson of <a href="http://soundcloud.com/sonuos" title="SonuoS">SonuoS</a>, and all at <a href="http://www.culture-box.com/" title="Culture Box">Culture Box</a>, for what was an amazing night at the club. To much to talk about right now, but I will post it about it over the coming days for sure.

We got back to our studio at about 6PM, and fell asleep straight away.

This post is inspired by two things. A wonderful gift I received passed onto me by Finn, from Ulf Eriksson at <a href="http://www.kontra-musik.com/" title="Kontra-Musik">Kontra-Musik</a>, the new TM404 release!!!!! Thanks so much for this, amazing, I can't wait to check this one out.

The second inspiration is from something Finn and Fredrik of <a href="http://soundcloud.com/a-o-t" title="AOT">AOT</a> mentioning about slow bpm, so this upload is a slow one.

Quickly thanks to everyone, all we met and heard, and special thanks to Finn for looking after us and making us party harder than we are used to :)

Enjoy the upload
