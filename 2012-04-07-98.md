## Nothing but noise seemed to work.

Today has been full of a new sound in our studio…that of the Playstation 2 and Forbidden Siren 2.

Both me an Lucia enjoy games immensely but haven't owned a games machine for years, mainly this is because it doesn't allow for much else to happen when it is on.

I haven't actually played it myself today, but Lucia has been playing it most of the day while I have sat beside her reading and programming. Although quite enjoyable, nearing the end of the day my mind is full of zombie moans, gun fire, and the erie score that accompanies todays choice of game. As a result of this, creating something for todays upload I have experienced for the first time in many years…a numbness. 

I must say it is quite fascinating to feel and experience such a different feeling, and one that reminds me of a similar feeling when staying with friends or parents after having watched a great deal of television, this being something else I don't really do.

As a result of today I have found only the dense sound of noise seemed of interest, and I believe this is partially due to the sounds I have been influenced by today, but also as this sound works as a temporary block to these new sounds in our home.

I am quite pleased to have experienced this distraction and slight removal from my normal experience of home, as in a way it reminds me how much sound can influence and shape a persons day, character and home.
