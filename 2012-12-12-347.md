## 12 step 303 patterns.

Today I sat with the D16's 303 emulation, the <a href="http://www.d16.pl/index.php?menu=10" title="Phoscyon">Phoscyon</a> in an attempt to understand certain basic functions of the Roland TB303 and how this affects the sound.

Bit by bit I went through various settings and simple sequences until I could easily place this into a emulation of my own in the Nord Modular.

Finally, a reasonable TB-303 emulation in the Nord G1â€¦well, a promising start at least.

I did also briefly browse this very helpful, albiet quite confusing set of patches for the G2, at the <a href="http://173.201.189.104/forum/topic-10430-50.html" title="Electro Music Forum">Electro Music Forum</a>. I say confusing, as although much of it made sense, I don't own a G2 so couldn't really learn much from testing it. Still, some things were helpful it turns out.

Incidentally, if anyone would like my TB303 emulation patch I am happy to pass it around. :)

There doesn't seem to be many available for the G1, so it would be good to have a few people improve on it or use it.

Obviously the Nord patch doesn't sound close in many ways to the 303, but I feel it has enough characteristics to be quite enjoyable to use and to learn from.

Tonights upload is using 2 of the TB303 emulation patches, along with 2 TR606 emulation patches, and a few FX. I should also mention the actual upload itself doesn't use the 303 patch in a typical 303 way, in fact it hardly sounds like a 303 at all to be honest. 

Yes, I did also wonder why make a 303 style patch to then only make it sound nothing like it? Well I suppose if I wanted a 303 sound, I would buy or borrow one, but what I find enjoyable is taking certain characteristics from one machine, and trying to put it into another. This is something I always remember Autechre mentioning in an interview long ago, after they had been using the Nord Lead for most things. Trying to re-create what the Nord could do, but in something else, really pushes that equipment and also the creative relationship you might have with it. 

I hope you enjoy the upload.
