After yesterdays experience of <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_86/" title="Lucia's creation with the Nord Modular" target="_blank">Lucia's creation with the Nord Modular</a>, I set about making something myself with more focus on simplicity than I might have done already. Really this was to ensure I keep the creative process as simple as possible, and although the sound might reveal much complexity, this is something I hope to find more in the listening, than in its creating. 

Normally the temptation to push my understanding of the Nord Modular finds itself in areas of unknowns, both sonically and psychologically. These unknowns in experimentation are of course good things, although the downside of this sort of experimenting comes in the form of sounds perceived as uncertain also, having direct influence on all manner of things, especially questions of taste. On reflection and away from the creative process, these sounds take on another form, often surprising me, and I find myself liking them after all. This can become quite confusing day after day, with a feeling that emerges of a general uncertainty, a lacking of confidence in creation and a waning of focus, all of which are obviously no good.

What I wanted to achieve today was simply to create something I like listening to, and enjoyed creating. This seems a rather silly thing to say now I type it, as after all, surely I should always do this. What seems apparent the more I do these uploads, is that I often spend more time in attempting to create something I am uncertain of, than I do of which I simply enjoy.

Ultimately it is a issue of balance for me. Yes, push creatively, but also ensuring a the creative process that is fruitful, stimulating, and dare I say it even enjoyable from time to time.
