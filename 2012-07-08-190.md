## Experimental shifts.

A bit of a odd one for this upload, being something of a combination of some ideas previously explored, but not really feeling its working out all that well this time. My concentration hasn't been great today feeling pretty exhausted and perhaps this is influencing my judgement of the result a little. An early night is much needed I think.

But as often is the case its difficult to tell with such regular uploading. I feel this upload has something of worth so wanted to share it. There is something interesting going on with the patterns shifting, altering the track structure. So I feel I should document it, move on, and try another day :)

It may be of interest to some of you and I hope you enjoy it all the same.
