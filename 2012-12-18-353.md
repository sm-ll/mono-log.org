## Fuzz and buzz.
audio: 353
---
A late upload for tonight, partly caused and influenced by all the buzz and fuzz I have been trying to cure in my new Dynacord delay unit.

For what was sold to my partner for my Christmas present and advertised as perfect working order is far from it. Its full of buzz from the mains transformer and a dodgy connection on the board causes problems with the stereo reverb/delay. It also had a very dangerous cut and bad re-join in the mains cable cut and also a very badly soldered mains cable to the mains transformer. I believe it is the transformer itself that is causing the buzz in the audio, as this also buzzes. Although the seller has a return policy, I have a bad feeling about it, and so already looking at replacement transformers and schematics of the machine.

Not amused.

I must admit, it is things like this that really annoys me and what I consider a total lack of respect for another personâ€¦anyway, nobody is perfect or should they be, so I don't want to turn this into a moan and will sleep and awake refreshed, and maybe with some good news. At the very least I have some new coffee to try.

As a result I feel tonights is a bit of an odd upload but sometimes this is just how it goes. Still, your ears might be fresher than mine right now, so I hope it is enjoyable all the same.

Thanks for listening.
