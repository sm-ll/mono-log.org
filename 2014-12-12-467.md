A late upload after a busy day but hopefully worth the wait.

A long jam, kind of making it up as I go along. It has some nice little parts I think. 
This is often the sort of stuff I do when playing about and not hitting record or getting a track together (whatever that is), just jamming the machines and experimenting. Today I figured I would record some of it.

Oh, and that's me in the photo a few years back visiting where I grew up, and as is often the case, appreciated it more since I have left.

Enjoy.
