Some tones and noise texture layering for tonights upload. 

This started as a much darker mood but finally ended on something that fits a more homesick or dreamy feeling. I can't say any of these were what I intended, but sometimes the sounds just seem to do what they want, which I am more than happy to allow.

I think todays upload is a result of the various sounds I have been listening to today, and I hope this is one can end the day well.

Enjoy.
