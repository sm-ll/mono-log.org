Compressed rhythmical textures for tonights upload. This was something of a surprise actually, working with heavy compression I found that in a certain patching combination some rich textures can be achieved through overloading the compression. 

Generally I have something of an uncertainty with the 'correct' usage of compression, having experienced in the past a general dislike for that typical dipping that is heard with heavy compression. For me I am not so convinced it is a bad thing, so in light of this have decided to go with it, keeping it in tonights upload.

Again, sounds are created using pulse modules running through filters and envelopesâ€¦ I really can't get enough of the pulse module :)

I hope enjoy tonights little experiment.
