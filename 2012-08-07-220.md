## Sm-ll parts (simply broke).

Some more broken beats for tonights upload. I have to say I am enjoying this sort of abrupt spluttering of rhythm along with longer gaps around it, certainly having lots of fun with this Nord Modular.

A quick post today as I am beginning a new job tomorrow, one I am very excited about, and hopefully the first step in ensuring a solid beginning to the launch of my label Sm-ll in Jan 2013. My biggest concern is making the label happen in the best way possible is funding it, so I am looking forward to working very hard to make it happen and hopefully bring some great artists to release with me.

Speaking of labels, I can now say that the new label <a href="http://www.facebook.com/sonuos.records" title="SonuoS" target="_blank">SonuoS</a> managed by the amazingly supportive, friendly and talented <a href="http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/finnoftomland" title="Dj Finn of Tomland " target="_blank">Dj Finn of Tomland</a>, resident at <a href="http://www.culture-box.com/" title="Culture Box" target="_blank">Culture Box</a>, is releasing my first ever 12" Vinyl record. I am obviously thrilled. I can't say much more than this, but its coming soon, so keep an eye/ear out.

Also the amazing <a href="http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/kennethchristiansen" title="Kenneth Christiansen" target="_blank">Kenneth Christiansen</a>, has put it in <a href="http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/kennethchristiansen/top10?chart=115193" title="his top 10 for this month.">his top 10 for this month.</a>

Along with this and us finally getting our money back from the cancelled <a href="http://www.blocweekend.com/" title="Bloc Weekend" target="_blank">Bloc Weekend</a> here in London, Its been a very good day all round.

This post is no longer short so it's time to sleep.

I hope you enjoy todays upload.
