I am quite pleased with todays upload, as finally I have been able to find the inspiration to do something closer to a style I have been threatening to go back to and explore for a long time.

It is thanks to <a href="http://julienbayle.net/" title="Julien Bayle">Julien Bayle</a> who kindly <i>liked</i> one of my recent uploads, and through that I found his inspiring sounds under his artist name <a href="http://protofuse.bandcamp.com/album/bits-0" title="Protofuse">Protofuse</a>. 

Specifically for me I really liked the <a href="http://protofuse.bandcamp.com/album/bits-0" title="bits#0">bits#0</a>, <a href="http://protofuse.bandcamp.com/album/bits-1" title="bits#1">bits#1</a> and <a href="http://protofuse.bandcamp.com/album/bits-10" title="bits#10">bits#10</a> online self releases, finding it a rare balance of minimal techno and dub influenced…hmm, I gringe when I write that…basically the <i>good</i> stuff, you know what I mean, somewhere between Taylor Deupree's techno work and Plastikman's early Concept releases, both amazing works. So it was this in my mind this evening when creating something for todays upload.

I have to say also, the sounds created this evening are part of yesterdays patch tweaked into what you hear today, and so the sounds are really a result of playing with the Nord Modular, more than setting out to do something particular. Its nice when this happens.

Also rather coincidentally, or rather the internets scary connections to everything and everyone, I had seen <a href="http://julienbayle.net/2012/03/17/my-first-app-on-app-store/" title="his new app mentioned on his blog">Julien's new app mentioned on his blog</a> earlier today and recognised it from years back as an experiment in Processing, a software I was experimenting with at the time. 

It is amazing when bumping into people online in this way and I hope I can do it some more.
Hope you enjoy todays upload.
