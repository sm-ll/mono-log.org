## 7 days of minimal 1
audio: 70
---
I have decided to work to a theme for the next 7 days uploads. I find creating things without much restriction quite difficult, and although for the most part using the Nord Modular only is a huge restriction already, as I become more used to using it, I feel the need to impose a further restriction. 

Having looked at the amount of uploads that have fallen to the somewhat inadequate categories I have created for them, I have found that surprisingly the one with the least uploads falls to the category Minimal. So as the sub heading already states, the next 7 days are going to be focusing on very minimal sounds.

There is often a feeling among some people that creating minimal sound work is easy, perhaps due to there apparently being less to hear, but for anyone who has created minimal work, will know all to well this is really not the case nor a good way to listen in general. I am not suggesting either that minimal is in anyway harder to create than other sounds or genres, but really that any assessment of difficulty cannot be simply understood as quantitative one.

This reminds me of a time a few years ago when I was stunned and slightly insulted, when I was politely told that when I gain experience and develop further, that I will move beyond mere sine tones, and that it was ok for now to use them and to not worry that I do so. They also felt there was nothing more to be said with a sine tone, as if saying something again was not important, nor that something can be said differently with the same sound. 

The genre they associated themselves so proudly within, seems one fixed in a traditional idea of forward thinking, and yet seemingly against the actual act of forward thinking itself.

The very idea of something being 'done' frustrates me quite a bit, and I have yet to really experience anything so completely 'done' in one movement or work.
