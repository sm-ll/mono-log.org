Some more experiments in rhythmical structures working less on the triggering of many sounds to make less, and more in triggering less to make just enough.

My experience of what is often called and perhaps mistaken as minimal, seems a term used more in a stylistic focus than a result of process. This is not so say something can't be identified as minimal through a style, but it isn't style that strictly make it minimal. Really for me this idea of minimal comes through context and often is a means to a result than something overtly clear in the end result.

Arguably given the context of now, todays minimal techno for example 'is' minimal when comparing it to other forms of dance music for example. However, I can't help feel a little disappointed that a genre such a minimal techno has in actual fact become far busier or fussier overtime than what it was in its past, and that I would have hoped a stem of techno named minimal, would be exactly that.

For me it isn't about what the sound is that I am listening to that makes it minimal, but more a how much is happening through whatever sounds are used, that makes it minimal.

I kind of feel an ideal delivery of minimal is one in a butting up again that point of doing just enough to get away with it. It doesn't do anymore than it needs to with a constant question of, is this to much, or what can I take away. It s always to be understood as an ideal, and not something reachable. As taking things away until nothing is left removes what it is entirely, so there is always that balance, or that to and fro that I feel occurs constantly in the creative process. The sounds used, are used in ways that aid this process and not picked as they sounds 'minimal'.

For me personally, the enjoyment of something minimal comes through the fact it does litte and it does this very well.

Often I have heard people say something like 'but anyone could do that'. Well to this I always feel it is not about who 'could' do what, but who 'does' what. 

A track not done because anyone could do it, is a track never made and therefore nobody can do it.

Enough of my rambling for tonight.

I hope you enjoy the upload.
