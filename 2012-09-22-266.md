## Late pulses.

Back in our studio after <a href="http://www.mimosamoize.com/about" title="our" target="_blank">our</a> performance tonight, tired but relaxed. It was a fun evening catching up with few people with our performance going ok.

Oddly me and Lucia both had a certain unsettling tone from our performance, stuck in our mind or ear somehow. Even now after creating this upload it is still there. 

Its not often I can say having ever had a tone stuck in my mind, a song or melody maybe. I think we might have to use this tone again.

Tonights upload is somewhat inspired by tonights sounds, both a result of mixed creations and also a sort reset for my ears. I think it turned out ok considering how long a day its been and how sleepy I feel.

Sorry for the slight lateness of this one, I hope it was worth the wait.
