Some more minimal patterns working around the sound style of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TB-303" title="Roland TB303" target="_blank">Roland TB303</a>, specifically the bass and low frequency squelch.

Although I have to say having used a 303, I much prefer and enjoy using this sound when coming from the Nord Modular, than I ever did when using the TB303 itself. Having said that perhaps now if I tried it again today, it would be different and far more enjoyable, as it was some 15 years ago, when all that could be heard was 303's. Perhaps I would be able to find the other sounds in the 303, like I did in the TR606, the 'sssh' sound when overdriving the signal of sequenced but turned down hats, or the beautiful 'tcktcktckt' from the trigger signals from within the circuitry.

I am also reminded of these sounds in these machines through finding some more within the Nord Modular. As often is the case, when driving bass through certain routes in the signal on much equipment, other subtle sounds can be heard seeping through. I have found when running bassy thud, muted kicks or similar sounds through the panning module, but not actually panning it but using it to split to two channels, a subtle fuzz can be heard. It is things like this that excite me, and drives much of my direction and inspiration when actually making something. The low, thump, thud and muted bass sounds within any rhythmical track, often used as the basis or foundation of a track, I very much like and long to be the main part. I feel this is very much the case with tonights upload.

What I like most about the Nord Modular creating similar sounds to the classic Roland family for example, are sounds that are easily identifiable through similarity or familiarity, yet being emulations, able to reach beyond. Obviously this is exactly the case with many emulations, but being packed as such, the expectation is often high for accuracy with the actual result being rather disappointing. Somehow having <i>so</i> much flexibility in the Nord Modular, it is more a reference to that world of sounds and its possible usage perhaps, enabling a tuning of it to the track beyond accuracy of the equipment it emulates and as a result possibly a better sound because of it.

I have to admit, my longing desire for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-606" title="TR606" target="_blank">TR606</a> has evaporated slightly since creating similar sounds in the Nord Modular, something I am certainly going to revisit very soon. Although having just google the Wikipedia link for the TR606, seeing its lovely box once again, the desire is perhaps still lingering more than I might realise.

I remember back having listened to other peoples Nord Modular emulations or references to synths I have owned, although impressed, I was always left a little disappointed and perhaps this is due to not being the creator of the patch, or even really understanding how to change it or alter it to my liking. Now having learnt so much through doing these uploads, it is possible that my appreciation of these patches has changed. I have always felt that although not knowing how to play an instrument 'properly' is vital to creating something interesting with it, knowing how to play it theoretically there still remains the option to not play it. Additionally understanding the instrument or equipment at a deeper level, arguably does allow a deeper appreciation of it in general, or at the very least changes it both while using it and listening to it. The Nord Modular has not only allowed me to enjoy using <i>it</i> more, but creating synthesised sound in general.

Personally I feel there is no better time to learn anything than as soon as you are able, with the added joy of that there is always something to learn from it and from someone else's perspective or usage of it. If you have been tempted to add the Nord Modular to your studio, or even begun one with it, but have been put off by it possibly being too complicated, as with anything once you learn it, it really isn't all that complicated at all, and I would urge you to get one if you can find one.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload. I appreciate the sounds or style may have changed since the beginning and continue to change, so I really appreciate those of you who have contacted me, shared your thoughts and continued to support my Nord uploads. I can't thank you all enough :)

Enjoy.
