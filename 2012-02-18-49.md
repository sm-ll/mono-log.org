# 49
## 3 notes.
audio: 49
---

I decided this morning I was going to create a sound that is a simple a chord using envelopes, filters and simple LFO's.

I remembered when using my Nord Rack 2, a much simpler synth, a rather complex sound can be achieved by simply balancing the parameters, something I feel I have let slide a little while working with the complex patches of the Nord Modular. 

Today's upload is a reasonably rushed sound (its a bit hissy and flat), consisting of a basic chord randomly alternating 3 simple notes, G, D and E, with a touch of EQ, but it already has a great deal more excitement about it than say yesterdays overly busy effort.

I like it and so might work on this sound more tomorrow.
