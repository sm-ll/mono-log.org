A subtle Detroit sounding play about for tonights upload.

Its been a nice time recently reminding myself of where I have come from musically, with even today me and Lucia catching up, while listening to different music chatting about how we hear it from each of our perspectives.

It reminds me of how much we hear things in certain ways, and although I often mention this, when actually compared with other people it really is quite enjoyable to hear a little how they might.

Having that in my mind while approaching tonights upload, perhaps fuelled its direction, who knows. All I do know is the sound of Detroit techno is very much something I grew up with, and perhaps most notably was the sound of <a href="http://www.carlcraig.net/" title="Carl Craig's" target="_blank">Carl Craig's</a> music, someone who sounds was always forward thinking and an inspiration because of this.

I hope you enjoy tonights upload, and its makes up in a small way for the cancellation of Bloc this weekend.
