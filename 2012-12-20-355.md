More explorations in the toms found in the Roland TR-606, and no flying balls of fire in the sky.

I just love the sound of this machine, always have, so much so that I have done yet another emulation of these sounds, doing my best to replicate the frequencies found in <a href="http://anasynth.ircam.fr/home/english/software/audiosculpt" title="Audiosculpt">Audiosculpt</a> through subtle use FM Synthesis. The people at Roland certainly are perfectionists.

I am really pleased with these emulations and feel they are by far the most accurate I have made yet. More exciting than that is I have used some techniques learned from previous uploads and from reading some sections of <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/search?url=%2Fsearch&Keyword=%22synth+secrets%22&Words=All&Summary=Yes" title="Synth Secrets in Sound On Sound.">Synth Secrets in Sound On Sound.</a> The main learning is through the mention of something called Bridged-T Oscillators, apparently a cheaper electronics technique creating a self decaying oscillator and was mainly used in creating the Roland TR-808 Bass Drum boooooom sound.

Unfortunately this can't really be accurately re-created in the Nord Modular, but something that can is using an envelope and mixing this output with a pulse and using this combination to control the decay or overall shape of a sound. Its a subtle difference, but one that does make that little difference.

Tonights upload basically uses two almost identical patches, with one having mainly just different pitch, envelope and sequences. Very quickly a Tr-606 tom can become bass booms and tones without to much changed. Very flexible, and very enjoyable to use.

I hope you enjoy the upload.
