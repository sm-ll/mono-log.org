I am not really sure I have succeeded in creating what I wanted today, although time will tell. I was aiming for something with a much lighter sound but seemed to have ended with something else. Although how this sound is perceived is quite dependent on the volume it is played and what aspect of the sounds is listened to the closest. I think I must have been listening closely to certain parts of the sounds and at a low volume. Still, it is what it is, and I am sure it will sound different with time.
I hope it is enjoyable all the same.
