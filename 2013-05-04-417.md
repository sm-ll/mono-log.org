A quick post, and the first for some time.

Time has been the biggest challenge once again, but focus is very much on music.

Last weekend brought two people together, creating sounds, drinking coffee and sharing dreams.

Today I am sharing something with you that I created recently inspired by this meet.

Main sound sources are a chord provided by Mike Oliver, played through my Akai S2800, sequenced by my new Alesis MMT-8. Also some trusty silver boxes creep in.

Enjoyâ€¦more to come tomorrow.
