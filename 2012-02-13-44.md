## Remaining rain.

I have always enjoyed rain. I remember as a teenager growing up in my home town of Swanage, I would stand on the edge of the cliff, looking out to sea, my most fondest memories of those times are being alone and experiencing nature on its stormiest of days.

I remember liking, and still do now, the smell of someone returning home, carrying the scent of rain with them, like a cat coming home for its food and with it a lingering odor of oil from its sheltering under a car.

Some of my favourite films are cloaked in the comfort of rain. Seven, directed by David Fincher, an incredible film for sound and atmosphere, but always with the rain pushing down those who struggle to live through life and its chalenges, and only at the end does the rain seem to clear as the world of our characters breaks. 

Goodbye Dragon Inn, from which I have borrowed todays image, another film leaking at the screens edges, much as the film itself plays with what is watched and who does the watching. A film that is so incredible in every way, that if you haven't seen it I urge you to make it the next that you do.

The Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell, a truly breathtaking vision and demonstration of ambiguity in life, with another amazing use of rain and its remnants pouring into chase and fight sequences, adding a sense of serenity, something that is amplified and both pondered in the amazing music sequence while passing through the city.

For me, with the steady falling of rain comes a moment of peace and contemplation, that is soon to dissipate as the skies begin to dry.
