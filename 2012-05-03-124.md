## Feeding of the emotion.

Todays upload is arguably my most ferocious so far, so for those of you who like your sounds delicate, beware.

I am feeling this one as somewhere between the more abstract tracks on <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Surgeon-Basictonalvocabulary/release/777" title="Surgeon's Basic Tonal Vocabulary" target="_blank">Surgeon's Basic Tonal Vocabulary</a> and perhaps some moments in the recent and incredible <a href="http://www.t2x.eu/" title="Sendai album Geotope" target="_blank">Sendai album Geotope</a>, both of which I highly recommend, the later having some beautifully emotional moments.

I must say I am very surprised by my uploading such sounds to this blog, and thinking back to the beginning would never have thought such intense or aggressive creative output would have occurred, I am probably as surprised as some of you listening.

Although partly todays upload is a deep and distant enjoyment of creating such sounds, there is also the balance of bass and texture that has always been something I have enjoyed. For the most part, when I create something I am uncertain in technically achieving, I would often use another style that provides a sort of stepping stone in understanding a technique, serving as a sort of template whereby further experimenting can be built upon.

I have always had an interest in patterns, rhythm etc hence <a href="http://www.mono-log.org/snd_20/" title="such early uploads exploring around work of Mark Fell" target="_blank">such early uploads exploring around work of Mark Fell.</a> For me, I have always wanted to find a point between structure that is understood as one genre, and yet falling outside it also. Mark Fells solo work, unlike his other project SND, stands as something for me that is questionably club based, perhaps the more unorthodox club admittedly, but through the likeliness of listeners and cultures adjustment to sound, certain sub genres or branches are viable all of a sudden in a context that perhaps initially may not have been.

Obviously this is all speculation, but this does make me remember a time where music was about the future, about how it could progress, how it might sound and what influence this may have on us all. From my perspective, this seems to have changed over the years, and innovation has moved away and been replaced with such things as hybrid or nostalgia influenced sound. Of course I am not suggesting this music is not good, in fact much of it is very good, but once where focus was towards a future, this future seems ever more uncertain and unconsidered.

Perhaps I will revisit this area in a future post, but until then I hope you can enjoy todays upload.
