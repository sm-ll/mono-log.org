## Texture loop.
audio: 230

A little experiment with repetitive textures, reminiscent of vinyl record run outs, with perhaps a touch of resonance through the needle head as the loops wears itself down. It has some similarities with my older experiments with vinyl that I have uploaded to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/moize/sets/vinyl-experiments-1/" title="Soundcloud" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a>, something I have always enjoyed.

I hope you enjoy them and tonights upload. Have a nice weekend.
