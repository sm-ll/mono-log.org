A bit late in uploading today, sorry about this. I have been busy working on new material for a <a href="http://www.mimosamoize.com/" title="Mimosa|Moize" target="_blank">Mimosa|Moize</a> release later this year. So I hope you can forgive me.

Much like yesterday I had plans for a very different sound than what I am uploading, but it seems I can never really know what it will give out from one day to the next, such is the world of the Nord Modular.

This is perhaps the simplest patch I have made in the Nord Modular, and yet managed to get some quite complex texture and rumble out of it, so I hope you enjoy it, but it is very bass heavy so careful of those speaker cones. I suggest headphones but if you are using speakers use your volume with care, as you should anyway.

Expect tomorrows upload to be much earlier in the day, and again sorry for the lateness of this one.
