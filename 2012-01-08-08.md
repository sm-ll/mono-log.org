## Sonic inference.

My building has very thin walls, very thin ceilings, very echoey corridors, very thin windows and very thin floors too. It also has many residents that don’t appreciate that their sounds are ‘also’ considered noise.

I often find myself being disrupted by the sounds of dogs, laughter, banging, sawing, drumming, singing, banter, sub bass, T.V’s, dog toys being thrown, car horns and punch bags.

I find when I hear these sounds that I am projected to their possible location, and during my time considering this uncertain place I ponder what the sound is, whose is its owner, and does the owner of this sound appreciate that I am experiencing a version of it too. I wonder what the place this sound originated from might look like, how their world is perceived to them and if they carry with them this sense of loudness wherever they might go.

In an effort to be less disturbed by these sounds, I have attempted to identify what it is about these sounds which disrupts me so. Perhaps who is responsible, or what it sounds like, the time of day…etc 

I have found ultimately it comes down to a few things, control, respect and responsibility. 

It is not the dog barking itself that annoys me, but more the lack of respect the owners of that dog exercise as to the regards of that dogs bark. It is not the sound of singing or the repetition of that singing that irritates me, but more my wish for it to stop with an equal realisation that it cannot. It is not so much the bass heard coming through my walls from a film, but more that I am being forced to know my neighbours taste for films and to learn of their routine.

Ultimately what frustrates me so, as I sit in my own studio with my headphones on, not so much to stop my sound being heard by others but more for a want to block out sounds ‘from’ others, is that we live in a world whereby a language of sonic inference is for the most part entirely missing.
