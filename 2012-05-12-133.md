## Further pattern testing.
audio: 133

Tonights upload is dealing with some further testing on the perception of sounds, such things as the role they might play in a pattern, the perception of frequencies and their role through headphones as apposed to speakers, and also attempting to find that point where something is no longer simple and ventures into complexity, something I feel this upload might…although some may simply say it sounds odd.

I have long enjoyed experimenting with low frequencies and shifting patterns, and even as a teenager proposed to some other artists the idea of using low frequencies to move speaker cones in order to disrupt or colour other frequencies, and also to encourage a visual pattern stimulus although perhaps not one matched in audible audio. Obviously these older guys thought I was a bit strange, which was a shame and also a good example why being surrounding by the right people is really a great thing, and being surrounding by the wrong people…well.

Over the years I have experimented on occasion with such ideas, and in addition to these ideas have often experimented with how one listener assembles patterns in sound, when heard in the context of that genre. I think all these early experiments are certainly to what I now realise to be a foundation to part of the output of Sm-ll, although more specifically perhaps through the Series.

Todays sound also uses these ideas in mind, but formalised in a way that for me attempts to find genre and yet also attempt in its own variations to remove those very aspects that make it so. A sort of understanding and reaching of a system to only challenge it.

I can't say or claim to have reached what I am trying to, or think really it be overly possible to reach, but for me this really isn't the point. I very much like working using such a concept to provide a spring board, more than functioning as the idea of an ultimate goal. If there was such an ultimate goal, it would really be to appreciate the now whilst in the midst of process, more than an idealistic sense of achieving the unachievable.

It is just past midnight here, and I promised myself an early night after not feeling 100% these last few days, so I will end my late night and most likely fragmented thoughts here and say, I hope you enjoy this upload.
