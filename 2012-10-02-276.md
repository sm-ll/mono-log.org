## Cornered to reflection.
audio: 276
---

There are times in our life where we reach point that could easily lead us into a corner. That corner leaves us little choice, little maneuverability, and an existence that we have little say or belonging.

I always think it is important in times like these that we reflect upon our current position and the journey that led us, and remind ourselves of what is important to us in our life.

I hope you enjoy listening to tonights upload as much as I did creating it.
