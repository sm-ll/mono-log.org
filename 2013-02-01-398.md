## Embracing the unexpected.

Often the temptation is to avoid or tread carefully around the unexpected. We want to know all the answers before we even know the questions. The questions are often not even clear enough to be questions, and as we might battle with comprehending such confusion, it is no wonder the outcome can be frustrating when pushing against something that is not ready to be pushed.

The perspective comes in embracing the unexpected. Allowing it to do what it does, as we might sit back and wonder, learn, be playful in the situation as it happens.

When I was younger I would forever want to understand, or be in control of myself, my actions, my feelings, my creativity, my aims. However, with all the effort placed on pushing something that was not ready or even designed to be pushed, come frustration, difficulty and a total opposite of what was really the point.

The point is then, to enjoy what you have now, and to tease towards what could be, but ultimately be relaxed, let things move as they should, and follow the gut to the right decisions if and when they need to be made. The decision is made more through an understanding of the decision not leading to outcome, but reassuring a perspective. A decision made has no guarantee of leading to the outcome predicted, but more a way to assure that the direction is what is settled on. Make a decision on a direction, and allow things to play their part in the story, while expecting the unexpected. 

There is a sense of letting go, tempting things, seeing what happens and believing in the gut.
