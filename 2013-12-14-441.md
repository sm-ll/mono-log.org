A very quick sketch today created after returning home after a pleasant night out with friends… then suddenly realising I still haven't done my upload.

These times are always hard, with the temptation of not bothering very high. Still, to try and create something very, very quickly is a challenge in itself, also working within areas of sound or structure you know but perhaps have not explored as much, it is these times are a perfect for that. That allowing of things to not matter so much given the circumstances, and just letting something interesting, yet simple happen.

It is times like this that I should allow into my days more often… and after some discussion tonight, I will.

A New Years promise to myself, something will be different next year and I believe it is one of those missing pieces.

Enjoy the upload.
