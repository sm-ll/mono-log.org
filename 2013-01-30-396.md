## A new machine, and familiar world.

Familiar paths often emerge on a journey that creates experience. They seem to be ones we have been down before. A feeling of something folding in on itself, testing, challenging, prodding. Conflicts of interest are brought to the fore, creating cuts that ride deep into the core, testing ones beliefs, desires and parental hand-me-downs.

Old tales flare up, stories that bite and bite and bite. They test your place in your life, what you are, what you might become and what you owe and to whom.

Making a choice is often presented as the answer, but a paradox is always in play, where as a choice removes certain things, and so stands as a deletion as much as an acceptance of a possible. Patience is what is needed, until there is no longer a choice to make, it has been already agreed on, it has been made by life.

All that remains then is taking that brave step forward and commit. The answer or the outcome is then no longer feared as no more is a decision made from choice, it is now the only way, and the result is just that. The result takes nothing away from the reason. If it did, and it changed the desire, then the choice still remains and patience has been pushed and things have been rushed.

The saying goes, be patient, time will tellâ€¦oh how true that is.
