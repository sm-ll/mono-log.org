## Division patterns.

Tonights upload is experimenting with the clock divider module in my Nord Modular. To explain what this does, it essentially receives a trigger signal and passes through the signal depending on its setting. For example, if set to '4', it will send out a single signal for every four it receives.

This is really handy for creating all manor of timings.

The main way I had been always using the clock divide module, was for the playing of a sound, when recently I realised I could also use it for the cancelation of a continuos triggering of sounds. So thinking of it basically the other way around, instead it would play every three sounds received, and only cancel out every fourth.

With the possibility of what this controls being pretty open in the Nord Modular, this has open up the potential of this machine again.

I first started exploring what I have been calling 'the gap', in some earlier uploads, and even with the TR-606, for example, a constant drilling of sounds but with repeated gaps of which to base a groove around. This reminded me a little of typography, another passion of mine, whereby the gaps in between and around the type is arguably more important than the type itself. The idea of negative space, white space, all such things that are constant considerations in design. This also reminded me of Pulsar Synthesis, in the way that it uses cancelation of signals, to create more interesting patterns, breaking up the drilling of pulses. With all these things in mind, it just suddenly clicked to try this in the Nord.

So tonights upload, is a beginning of using this cancelling, to add some roughness to the patterns, creating I feel a very similar groove to some of the previous uploads, but with perhaps a generally noisy feel. I quite like the potential of this.

Anyway, regardless of the details behind this, I ultimately hope you enjoy listening to it.
