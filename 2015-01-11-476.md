Today's groove is created with the Korg Volca Sample.

This time I have recorded out grooves and then put them back into the Volca Sample. Mainly this is to get a better balance of the frequencies between sounds. On recording out I can drop off the bass or adjust it as it plays, and then re-use this loop or parts of it, putting it back into the Volca Sample but with the bass back to a higher position. Still, the bass is so huge on this machine that it's rarely in the plus.

Also for this one, I thought I would bring in the Roland Space Echo spring reverb, it's obvious when it appears so apart from the Space Echo, it's all Volca Sample.

Great machine.
