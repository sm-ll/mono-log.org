## Emotion driven creation.

So for tonights upload me and Lucia attempted in creating something at the same time for my own and <a href="http://smallmimosa.wordpress.com/" title="her daily blog uploads">her daily blog uploads</a>, using the same set of speakers. Both being very tired, and very frustrated as a result, it ended up not working out at all, not this time at least. So we decided to take it solo on this one. You can hear Lucia's solo experiments with sound, and quality writing <a href="http://smallmimosa.wordpress.com/" title="at her blog.">at her blog.</a>

However, not one to focus on emotion when I create, I decided this might be the prime time to do so and so focused on this frustration and general tiredness to create something a bit special. 

I decided on keeping the sounds I have already created while working with Lucia, as this put me somewhere quite creatively different from where I would be normally. Lucia tends to create sounds/tracks based around the perception of noise, although a more delicate noise, a kind of minimal noise which I always find quite special. In finding something to work with this, I ended up with very different patching than I normally would, so started there I ended with something very aggressive indeed.

I would like to say more about using emotion in creation, but will leave this for another post, feeling exhausted I think its best left for another day.

Enjoy the upload.
