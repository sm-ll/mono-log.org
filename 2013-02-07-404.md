## SM-LL cycles of life.

In sharing the first of two audio uploads and posts for tonight, I am brought to remember once again how things in our life have a habit of remerging, moulding us into who we are and challenging who we might want to become.

The circles of life, come back to prod at us once again, suggesting that perhaps we are not so sure about where we are, or what we want. A time of difficultly in a familiar story, tempting us and testing us.

A sound that we recognise, immediately taken us to a place that we remember, shown another in ways that smell might reveal. A sound that shows much we forget to remember, we reflect and drive forward with the confidence that what we create, sound, life, decision, can only be what our gut insists.

When creating, the sound is that what we enjoy, we are at our most happiest. It is the pure passion of being who you are that drives things forward, puts you were you need to be and with who you need to be there with.

Creativity in life through the sounds we make are not permissive    of something simple and easy. This world demands you are you, you are want you want, and you give to others what you have to give. It is relentless in its determination, the sounds are screaming to be heard, we just have to listen to them.
