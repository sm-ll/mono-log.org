More experimenting and exploration in the Korg Volca Sample.
This time I have been playing about with the incredible bass this machine has, plus, the artefacts that are often audible in samplers when using bass, that occur in panning or volume change specifically.

In addition to this, some twiddling of dials ;)

Enjoy.
