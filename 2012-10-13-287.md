Not feeling 100% today, and have been on the lemon and ginger after catching poor Lucia's bug.

This is probably this is why tonights upload sounds messy, perhaps in a good way, perhaps not, i'll let you decide. :)

Hopefully tomorrow will be better after some much needed rest.

Enjoy the scratchiness.
