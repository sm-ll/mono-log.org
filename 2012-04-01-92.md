## That sound.

Today's upload has been inspired by a few things, firstly it was created in a limited time which believe me <i>really</i> helps. Secondly today has been an amazing day, I woke up feeling great, the sky is beautiful and the events throughout the day, no matter how challenging, have ultimately been very positive…what can I say, i'm in a good mood :)

Also, me and Lucia have been listening back to my old archives through the ipod today while we've cooked food, ate, adjusted bars on Lucia's new bicycle and generally been chatting. Just as I sat down to create something today on the Nord, I overheard through my headphones a recent and quick remix of an old archive track come on the ipod, and I quickly decided to tune the Nord Modular to what I can hear and began to create something with a similar feel. It seemed to fit perfectly the spring air and sky, and is also what I often hear in my mind when I think of the Nord and its sound.

Finally, I have been looking at some images of <a href="http://www.knobsounds.com/" title="Yves" target="_blank">Yves</a> studio kit today, and was inspired when seeing his beautiful G2 Nord, the next generation to mine…very nice,…very jealous :)
I figured I should take a photo of my own lovely Nord Modular G1, seeing as there aren't many on this blog.

Today everything seems great, and so I hope my upload fits your day.

Enjoy :)
