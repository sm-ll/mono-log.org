This weekend I had hoped to get some of the mono-log uploads onto <a href="http://soundcloud.com/moize" title="soundcloud">soundcloud</a>, but unfortunately spent most of the time working on logos, font designs and setting up accounts and the website for the label <a href="http://www.sm-ll.com/" title="Sm-ll.">Sm-ll.</a> 

It is on my list for Monday and as soon as I return from work I will hopefully be able to share a month of two worth of uploads compressed and ready for a quick listen.

Tonights upload comes as a dry, textured groove created out of a combination of pulse generators, filters, envelopes, white noise and a few other bits.

I really enjoy the pulse modules in the Nord Modular, and although they can be a tricky bunch to work with, when things go well it is a joy to use them.

This upload takes me back to some of the earlier uploads I created near the beginning of the year, although this one having a more obvious rhythm feel.

Todays images is a still grabbed from <a href="Marcel Duchamp - Anemic Cinema" title="Marcel Duchamp - Anemic Cinema">Marcel Duchamp - Anemic Cinema</a>.

Enjoy.
