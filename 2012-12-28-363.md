## Mono-log 2012 toâ€¦

So first off for those of you who don't already know from my mentioning it on Facebook earlier today, I have decided I will be continuing these uploads past the end of this year, with no set end as of yet. There will however be a change with the blog itself.

The main changes are nothing to worry about, everything you like already will continue and stay the same, the main difference being this blog will be no longer be focused on my personal journey with the Nord, but will develop to encompass many other issues surrounding the electronic music sphere.

I aim for the writing to be better thought out, focused and structured to hopefully read better for more people than just Nord Modular enthusiasts, and not rushed as they are currently. I aim to deal with many issues, some I have touched upon already with this blog, but now with the better freedom and less personal diary style as is currently.

It will still be mainly me, although might have invited guests on occasion both in audio and in the writing. I will still do an upload each and every day as now and still very much Nord based, but might include other Nord products, such as the G2, Micro Modular or maybe even the Rack 2. I will also have a new section specifically for patches to download and will be looking into adding commenting to each post.

I would appreciate anyones feedback on new features as they arrive and hopefully Mono-log can be something we can all be happy with and not just my own personal creative website.

Basically I will be looking to develop the blog and not stop anything good that has already begun.

Lastly tonights upload is something that perhaps shares some similarities with my creative journey a a whole and with the Nord products. 

This upload began with my trying to track down the buzz problem I have with my Nord Modular connected to the Space Echo. I have found the problem, I think. While trying to track this buzz down, I decided on using the Nord Rack 2 for ease and also as I haven't used it in some time. Immediately I remembered how amazing this synth is. This eventually ended up my creating what could have been todays upload, but I decided to use this as the starting point and then replicate this in the Nord Modular.

Although the end result is very different, it does stand as perhaps the simplest patch to date, and as a result has much in common with my earliest of creations with the Space Echo and Roland machines. It is arguably Pokk! in its purest and earliest form. A muted bass resonance, delaying and moving.

I hope you are as excited as I am about the future of mono-log and enjoy tonights upload.

Thanks for everyones support, more soon.
