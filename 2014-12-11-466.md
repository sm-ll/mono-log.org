More experimenting with the Nord Rack 2 this time no sequencer, just the osccillators doing their thing. I have always loved the bass on this machine, extremely heavy and punchy and there is always the need to tame it down to fit in with anything, which gives great flexibility when working with it. It also has that classic Nord sound, albiet with more clinical bite than that found on the Nord Modular G1.

Yeah, Nord love.
