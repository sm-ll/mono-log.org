## Abstract times.

Its getting a little abstract in the early hours here in the studio.

After a few days of listening to streams from the likes of <a href="http://www.erraticnyc.com/techno-podcast/kenneth-christiansen-set" title="Kenneth Christiansen" target="_blank">Kenneth Christiansen</a> and <a href="http://www.erraticnyc.com/techno-podcast/inigo-kennedy-live-extended-set" title="Inigo Kennedy" target="_blank">Inigo Kennedy</a>, I have only chords, squelches and bass in my mind. I highly recommend (as was recommend me, thanks again Finn) visiting the <a href="http://www.erraticnyc.com/" title="Erratic website and having a listen. ">Erratic website and having a listen.</a>

I have yet again attempted a noodle-like patch in the Nord Modular, in a dub/techno-like style. I can't say I am totally convinced by it, but feel it is probably as close as I could get and with it being only one patch for sound and a second for compression and a bit of hiss, its not bad. I really feel the urge to play the chord instead of having multiple oscillators triggered, but I am determined to get the Nord Modular sounding somewhere handy in this style one way or another, and believe it is getting closer than some previous efforts.

Its interesting to use some of the techniques from other patches, but in a style of sound creation that perhaps doesn't quite gel as well, but is in some ways giving some interesting results. I like the off balance eq, and the resonant body sound to it…resonance being something I have always enjoyed working with ever since in my early teens, although perhaps it does just sound like Rod Modell in a bucket haha…(thanks Yves :) 

I hope to get uploads back to being earlier in the day, and perhaps begin this on Monday. I have been experimenting with different times of the day to create, for productive and focus reasons, but also to see how the time of changes the sound.

I hope you enjoy tonight's sound, I suggest standing in a resonant body big enough to hold you while you listen to it.

Good night :)
