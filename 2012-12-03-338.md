## Bass, resonance, texture.

I have been experimenting with some new ideas in the Nord Modular for tonights upload, after being inspired while working on an influences of the past mix for soundcloud, hopefully to make its way to an upload sometime this year.

Reversed like bass, textures and resonating chords while playing running again through the Space Echo, Phase 90 and a bit of EQ.

Tonights upload ended up being very different from what I set out to make, but thats how it goes sometimes.

I hope you enjoy it.
