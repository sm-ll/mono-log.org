## Sm-ll sketches 2.
audio: 119

Todays upload and writing come as further sketches and ideas in the building of a language towards the record label and vision I am working on, a plausible contribution for an ongoing continuum of sorts called <i>Series</i>, that would be housed under the main label name. 

The name of the label will be Sm-ll (pronounced small) and I invision it not only being a label that releases records, but with the intention of being something a little more, and that incorporates other interests and ideas I have been toying with over the years. It makes perfect sense to me to put them under one roof.

For the music side of things, I passionately want to deliver challenging and conceptual directed work but thats output is supported and informed by other releases on the label, a sort of restrictive freedom balanced against those releases on the main labels body that has more individual focus. I felt a purely challenging label by my standards might be almost impossible for others, and that a separation of sorts, one delivering good releases of a more flexible sort, the other being an even more own self indulgence, and so a separate of the two types of releases would be a much better way of dealing with everything in general.

Anyway, there is much more to come but I will hopefully be using another platform to tackle the finer details, to read about them and get feedback etc, namely in its own website.

Tonights upload also suffers from badly from our old friend the mp3 conversion. The sounds are exported at 192kbps, which admittedly could be set higher…but still.

Enjoys tonights upload, my old photography that I have been meaning to dig out…and watch this space :)
