Sorry for the slight delay in getting this upload done.

Earlier this evening I worked on some ideas with the TR-606 and various effects, which by the time I finished this took me late into the evening.

While creating this sketch in the 606, I decided I would work on a brand new patch emulating the sound in the Nord Modular. Particular I wanted to create a Nord patch that could include the 606's BD, LT and CH or OH variations. My main concern was getting a better sound BD and LT, and having the CH and OH all in the same patch, which tested me.

Although very time consuming and testing however, I succeeded, and am pretty happy with the results. 

With this patch I have created something similar in style to the sketch earlier today, using only the BD, LT and CH variations along with the Space Echo RE-201, MXR Phase 90 and Ten Band EQ, and Inkel Pro.MX-1200 audio mixer.

Lots of equipment names today, and lots of TR-606 experimenting, a machine I have to say still is one of my all time favourites, and certainly favourite drum machine of all timeâ€¦yes better than a 808 or 909.

Enjoy the upload.
