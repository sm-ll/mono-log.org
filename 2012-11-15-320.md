## Goodbye Pete Namlook.
audio: 320

Well, I don't know what to say really that hasn't been said or thought by many already, stunned once again.

The Definitive Ambient Collection was my first introduction to Pete Namlook and his incredible music. This introduction was not only one for me but for a few of my friends too, as they also bought and enjoyed this incredible album.

As teenagers listening to his music was an experience that took you out of this world. He created a mood that nobody else has come close, his classic stereo delay, the subtle dub patterns. His music is unique, and in many ways timeless.

I have sat with those friends listening, sat alone drifting, dreaming of a future, dreaming of another place, I have even decorated my room listening to his music. I remember specific times, places and feelings.

On occasion I might receive a text from one of my friends, or I might send one myself, and it would say something like this.

Definitive Ambient Collection…amazing. 

or

Dreamfish…classic

I think I even sent one of these texts earlier this year.

It seems no matter where in the world we might be, music can connect us. Old friends staying in contact, and with a few words we are able to stop what we are doing, and remember times spent listening to Pete Namlook's music.

I am sure these texts will still be sent for many many years to come. I know for certain I will certainly send them. But I imagine now along with that friendly reminder to a friend of that classic album once shared, it might also now say something like.

Pete Namlook…We miss you.
