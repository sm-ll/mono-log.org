## Plastic chords.

Some popping and melting chords for tonights upload that falls somewhere between some previous rhythmic experiments of the more dub sounds I have occasionally shared.

I am quite enjoying this one, reminding me of some old dub like experiments I created back around 2004 that I might share one day.

Also, sorry for some who have been enjoying the more involved writing of previous posts, I appreciate some of these of late have been quite brief and sporadic in focus. I can only say I have been working on some exciting things but do hope to work on some more interesting posts as soon as I can.

I hope you enjoy tonights creation.
