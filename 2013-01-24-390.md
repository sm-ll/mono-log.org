## Bass, whisky and fear.

Some challenging days have been upon me recently, and I feel these are best used as times to learn, stretch and work harder. Undoubtably this has influenced the sounds I have been creating as mentioned previously, and I feel for the better.

The world of over indulgence is a dangerous one, and sometimes that edgy and pressured situation is exactly what is needed to push creativity into an area that would often be sat on the periphery, tempting but resisted through fear.

Sometimes stepping into dangerous waters, taking that plunge and putting yourself in a position that is uncomfortable, is exactly what gives the result thats needed for that time. In this case, perhaps the bass heavy single sound of a looping kick drum, a sound supporting the fear and supported by the reassuring sip of Whisky.

Got out there, and do something your scared to do, make friends with your fear and create something incredible.
