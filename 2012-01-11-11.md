## You are always a child of your time, and you cannot step out of that.

Today was a struggle to get things sounding right, and I still don't think I really managed it…not even close actually. Still, what has come out of this long and rather overly exhausting morning of slight frustration is the relevance found in the inspiring minds on the <a href="http://www.helveticafilm.com/" title="Helvetica Documentary">Helvetica Documentary</a> that I watched last night. Here are some quotes from various contributors, specifically the last one that is perhaps my personal favourite from <a href="http://www.iconofgraphics.com/Wim-Crouwel/" title="Wim Crouwel.">Wim Crouwel.</a>

“So it may very well be that when it comes to trends, at least in graphic design, we've reached sort of the end of history. The pendulum that swings back and forth doesn't have any more directions it can swing in. The final trend may simply be the completely democratic distribution of the means of production to anyone who wants it or anyone who can afford it.”

“You can have a music studio for a couple thousand bucks, you can have a film studio for ten grand, you definitely can be a designer with one or two thousand dollars, and have basically similar tools as the people who do this for a living.”

“lf all these people have the tools to make good design, they realize that it ain't that easy. lt's not just opening a template in Corel Draw or in Powerpoint. lt's not about having the latest version of whatever program. lf you don't have the eye, if you don't have a sense of design, the program's not going to give it to you.”

“l remember, years ago, a friend of mine who produced radio commercials had five guys go out in the hallway of CBS Records and sing the beginning of ''Round Round Get Around, l Get Around'' by the Beach Boys. And they really tried, they rehearsed for a week to get their harmonies right, and they were the best vocalists who worked in that department on that floor, and they loved music. And they went out and they sang it, and of course they were totally flat and sounded horribly. . . terrible. But they'd rehearsed. And then the voiceover for the commercial said, ''Now you can appreciate the Beach Boys.'' And it's really sort of the same thing. The closer you come to it, and the more you see it, the more you appreciate it when it's terrific.“

“What we have is a climate now in which the very idea of visual communication and graphic design, if we still want to call it that, is accepted by many more people. They get it. They understand it. They're starting to see graphic communication as an expression of their own identity. And the classic case of this is the social networking programs such as MySpace, where you can customize your profile. You can change the background, you can put pictures in, you can change the typeface to anything you want, and those choices, those decisions you make, become expressions of who you are. You start to care about it, in the way you care about the clothing you're wearing as an expression of who you are, or your haircut or whatever, or how you decorate your apartment, all of those things. You know, we accept the idea of identity being expressed in that way, through these consumer choices. Well, now it's happening in the sphere of visual communication and there's no reason as the tools become ever more sophisticated, why this just won't go on developing, developing and developing.”

“Why you grab a certain typeface for a certain job has a different meaning than we grabbed a typeface in the fifties for a certain job. You are always a child of your time, and you cannot step out of that.”
