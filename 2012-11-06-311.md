## Clean dub.

A nice clean sounding dub groove for tonights upload, with a touch of the Inkel echo.

Today has been a day with <a href="http://pole-music.com/music/" title="Pole's">Pole's</a> music on pretty much repeat, and I think the influence is there in this upload. Pole has always made some amazing music but his style just seems to suit me more and more over the years, just getting better and better. An incredible artist.

Incidentally I am sure he uses a Nord Modular quite a bit in his music. I could be wrong, but it sounds very similar, but wonderful either way.

Enjoy and thanks for listening.
