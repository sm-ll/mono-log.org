So today I feel a damn sight better, and it really couldn't have come sooner. After being looked after by my lovely Lucia, and her reminding me I haven't had a coffee since Saturday morning, I fuelled up and have felt very active today.

I have spent a bit of time today thinking about the structure of my label Sm-ll that I am launching Jan 1st 2013, and things are starting to fall into place in terms of direction, focus and what Sm-ll is all about. Very excited.

Also, just a few moments ago I received a inspiring email from a person I have never met before, an amateur spanish sound designer called Pablo. He has recently bought a Nord G1, and is enjoying it as much as anyone would, as they are amazing bits of kit. He mentioned liking the uploads on this blog I list under rhythmic and pulse, which I have to say are my favourites too, so this really made my day.

Pablo also mentioned how it would be nice to see more pictures of the sounds I create in the Nord, which I have to agree, it would be nice to share more. My main concern is obviously as many of the patches are more sketches for tracks more than sounds to use in tracks. However, it is something I have often been asked, and so I figured I would start to share the odd image when I can.

I have started a thread over at the <a href="http://www.12k.com/" title="12k forum">12k forum</a>, that hoped to share more, as this is a better platform than my blog, but I appreciate for many having to join another forum might seem a bit to much. I would highly recommend it though, the 12k forum is a wonderful place with wonderful people, there is simply no other place like it.

I have decided to uploaded a quick picture for todays sound. It is taken with my iPhone in this late hour, so its not the best quality, but I hope it is shows something useful.

Todays sound focuses around the rhythm and pulse like sounds Pablo mentioned in his email, and I personally feel this is perhaps one of the better ones. On virgin ears things sound ok to me, so hopefully it will sound good another day too.

I hope you enjoy the upload, oh, one last thing, I did sneak in a little bit of Inkel Mixer Delay occasionally just to make it a bit more complete and where I might take it eventually. The Inkel delay is quite obvious, and so you should notice when it is on and not.

Enjoy.
