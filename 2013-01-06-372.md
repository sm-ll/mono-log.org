(Redefining Quality is a title taken from the book Poke the Box by <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/" title="Seth Godin">Seth Godin</a>)

I read a little while ago a captivating book called Poke the Box by writer Seth Godin. It is a very small book, more probably taking 30 mins or so tops to read. It's a face paced read and almost seems to demand reading at a face pace, and so I would recommend reading it if this post interests you. A classic example of one of the sections called 'When can you start?' goes like this "Soon is not as good as now.". My kind of book.

The section I want to talk about today, relates to how we think about the music we create, listen to and buy… or perhaps don't buy. As often for me personally, its really a matter of perspective. "You just gotta take a look a it"

Seth explains that in our present world "just about everything on offer – does exactly what it's supposed to. Things work so often that we're now shocked when a battery dies, a car gets recalled, orr we find a typo in a book."

His quite funny too, he continues:

"Most of your competition is now without defects as well–which means that quality is not so interesting anymore. – If you have quality and they have quality and that's all either of you offer, then your selling a commodity, and i'll take cheap, please. 

We have little choice but to move beyond quality and seek remarkable, connected, and new."

This idea of sameness, quality and what is remarkable got me thinking about the problem that is often mentioned by many artists and labels seemingly unable to sell their music.

I was speaking to my partner Lucia yesterday about this very issue, and we both compared what we can see from our perspective, the tactics used by different artists, intentional or not, that seems to help their music reach people.

I should mention I have found in the past the very mention of such words like tactics or any such similar word, is disliked by some people in the music world. I get the feeling, possibly as I probably as I thought this naively once before myself, is that we shouldn't need tactics, and that the music should speak for itself. In some ideal world probably so, but I think we live in that ideal weld already, and this isn't really a general reality.

When me and Lucia compared an artist who seems more aware of the different modes of both a creative and business mind, they seem generally far more successful in what they do or at least are better known. After all, the music might speak wonders, but if nobody is there to hear it then its not saying anything at all. If a record is speaks to us in a forest but nobody is there to hear it, does it speak at all?… or something like that.

When thinking again about what Seth is saying, and comparing this thinking to the mass of new artists all making variations of their niche, i.e. more drones, more recordings of water, more textures, more 4/4 beats, are we really to expect much of this to sell to begin with? In a huge pile of sameness, how do we know what good is anymore?

Is it all worthy of selling? perhaps in an ideal world ;) but as Finn Albertson said to me in response to yesterdays post, "we seem to be in a mental ice age", I agree, and I think this applies to both those that listen 'and' those that create. 

Perhaps in this reality, this ideal reality we are in now, and not parallel far off ideal some might dream of, we have to ask ourselves is there not something more that can be done to separate out from the mass of sameness?
In a world that is probably more connected than ever before, are we really using this connection affectively? 

As Seth says, "If you have quality and they have quality and that's all either of you offer…"
