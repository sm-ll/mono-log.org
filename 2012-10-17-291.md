## Searching for an edge.
audio: 291

Todays upload comes from exploring the quiet in the modules, trying to find that edge of where some interesting sounds might be found. 

This patch consisting of mainly filters, logic modules, some envelope followers and a few oscillators. I wanted to try and reach a different sound through using some more tricky methods in the hope that something new would happen.

I think it might have.

This upload is a simple loop, but I kinda of like it plodding along over and over again.

I hope you enjoy it too.
