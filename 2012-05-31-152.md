A slightly hypnotic and pulsating texture for todays upload, and one that also uses elements of sound from previous uploads in its style.

As is almost always the case, I made todays upload using my headphones, and although many of the uploads work just as well on speakers, I am not so sure of this one. However I need my ears to rest and adjust.

I find the nature of this type of sound quite fascinating to work with, the balance of sound being changed dramatically from headphones to speakers, the clicks or klonks that the ear finds tricky to establish a volume on headphones, are given a much louder and contrasting result when through speakers.

I have been working quite a bit with these uploads to embed micro changes in sound whose detail are really lost through speakers, giving out the more obvious thud of the rhythm. I quite like the idea of creating sound in this way, to deliver to very different results on speakers to headphones, and using the dynamic range along with the shortness of sound and how we hear that, to establish this sort of variety.

I have yet to really fully test it, but I would be interested in other peoples thoughts on this, and how it sounds on their sound system.

A slightly unusual one today I feel, but as always time will tell, stillâ€¦I hope you enjoy it.
