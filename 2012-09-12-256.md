Today has been a very long but very productive day, and all the while I have been enjoying the music of <a href="http://daphneoram.org/category/news/" title="Daphne Oram" target="_blank">Daphne Oram</a>. 

This undoubtably inspired tonights upload, being something of more abstract sound exploration with a hints of tape hiss, loops, saturation, clicking edits etc.

I feel this one is screaming for the Space Echo, and takes me back to the early records I made with tape delays back as a kid. However, This upload has no such thing on there, and is pure Nord Modular.

I hope you enjoy it, and if you haven't already listened to Daphne Orams amazing music, do so straight away.
