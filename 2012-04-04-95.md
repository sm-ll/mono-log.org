## Old times revisited.
audio: 95

I am really enjoying the experience of revisiting things, or understanding things from an alternative perspective. 

Over the last last few days the road in which our studio overlooks has been an alternative route for the buses. I presume there is some blockage or work on their normal route, although I haven't gone to investigate. This new experience is surprisingly interesting, I am not sure if this is my age (probably) or my growing interest of small things influencing and shaping us,  with us then shaping those things we come into contact with.

While thinking about the buses new route, I began to think about my older music and how these things have become something of classic to mine and close friends ears, each having their own idea of which is a classic and which is not. From this I started to think about our relationship with sound, the experiences we share with them and how that experience is often applied when revisiting that sound, shaping it again as we listen again.

I have often found creating alternative versions of music to be something I have never really found myself doing, always preferring to create something new, or create something to understand something confusing. Although through doing these uploads each day, I have found myself wanting to recreate things, not to improve them but to try to experience the sounds again but as some shapable experience, informing a new experience of the original sounds.

It has suddenly dawned on me where I might have experienced this when listening to the slightly reformed version of <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/northern/" title="Northern by Taylor Deupree" target="_blank">Northern by Taylor Deupree</a>. <a href="http://www.12k.com/index.php/site/releases/northern_reissue/" title="Northern Reissue" target="_blank">Northern Reissue</a>, is re-release of the previous album Northern that was sold out in 6 months, and so used as an opportunity to refresh and remix the album. For me, this choice of reworking something in this way, stands as perhaps one of the more exciting ideas delivered on <a href="http://www.12k.com/" title="12k" target="_blank">12k</a>.

I am still really thinking about all of this, but it excites me.

Finally, todays upload is revisiting a track done back around 2000, and although todays version is quite different to the original, it was an interesting experience working close to the original sensation experienced with this sound, and certainly something I will do again.

Enjoy :)
