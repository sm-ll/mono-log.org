For todays upload I decided I wanted to have some sort of Christmas theme, and so thought to use the Christmas present (Dynacord VRS-23) I received a little while ago from my partner Lucia more extensively with the Nord Modular, and very loosely base the whole upload around <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf-KqgJ323o" title="Jeff Mills track 'The Bells'">Jeff Mills track 'The Bells'</a>.

I hope you are enjoying your day and this upload is a good fit.

Merry Christmas!
