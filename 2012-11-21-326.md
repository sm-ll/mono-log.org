Something dark and moody tonights upload and perhaps something closer to those wet mixes I have mentioned before. The wet mix being a track written to work specifically with heavy use of effects, or written with effects from the beginning, but effects specific to colouring or changing the structure of the track more than simply added to it. I kind of like this idea, helps me think while I create too.

For todays upload I thought I would create something a little more straight sounding, based more around a feeling than abstract or technical thinking like yesterdays upload. However listening back to yesterdays I think I am getting into it a bit more, it sounds ok.

It seems some of you got into it quicker than I did, so I really appreciate the feedback :)

Lastly, there has been some talk of me and Lucia working on some more techno based music, so thats quite exciting. We are kicking around some ideas and some names, we quite like Veronik. What do you think?

Hope you enjoy the upload.
