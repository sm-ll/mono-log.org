A very dense and disrupting texture for tonights very late upload, apologies for the lateness.

There is something very pleasing about such thick and lost texture found in the Nord Modular, again an amazing synth, I can see myself using it almost everything after this year is over.

This upload begins with just Nord, then as some shifting occurs in the tones, this is where I am changing delay time on my Inkel mixer as I introduce some delay.

Its late here in London and everything sounds odd due to my sleepiness, so I hope things sound ok.

Enjoy.
